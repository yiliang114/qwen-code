/**
 * Decide whether a red `npm run test:ci:workspaces` was caused by the runner
 * rather than by the code, so the Test job can say so instead of reporting a
 * failure that no test produced.
 *
 * Vitest reports a worker whose `onTaskUpdate` RPC went unanswered as a
 * run-level *unhandled error* and exits 1 for it even when every test passed.
 * That RPC is worker→collector IPC, so it starves on CPU contention, not on
 * elapsed time. On the shared `ecs-qwen` pool — measured at load 218–270 with
 * 37–74 concurrent vitest processes per host — five of thirteen consecutive
 * red Test jobs on 2026-09-05 had zero failing tests: cli printed
 * `Test Files 1014 passed (1014)` and core `643 passed | 1 skipped`, then each
 * exited 1 on one to three of these timeouts.
 *
 * Nothing already in the lane covers it. `--retry=2` retries individual tests,
 * while this is reported after the run. `testTimeout`/`hookTimeout` (60s on
 * ECS) bound a test, not the collector channel — the RPC's own budget is a
 * fixed 60s (#10438). The 110-minute step ceiling never engages: no job in
 * that sample was cancelled, and the longest test step finished on its own at
 * 96m55s.
 *
 * The sanctioned fix elsewhere in this repo is `dangerouslyIgnoreUnhandledErrors`,
 * which every vitest config already carries as `process.platform !== 'linux'`
 * and scripts/tests/unit-vitest-configs.test.ts pins. Linux is deliberately
 * left fatal, and rightly: packages/core/src/extension/archive-safety.test.ts
 * documents a minipass `write after end` that escaped as an uncaught exception
 * under CPU contention and exited an all-green suite non-zero (release run
 * 33576013293). That one was a real defect in an unawaited stream, so the
 * remedy was to fix the test, not to stop looking. Flipping the flag on Linux
 * would swallow the next one too.
 *
 * That is the distinction this classifier exists to draw. `onTaskUpdate` is
 * vitest's own worker IPC and carries no information about the code under
 * test; an escaping product exception does. So tolerate the former by name and
 * keep the latter fatal — which a whole-run boolean cannot express.
 *
 * Tolerating is only safe on positive evidence, so every branch below fails
 * closed. The exit is attributed to a workspace only when npm named that
 * workspace, that workspace wrote a junit.xml, and its totals report at least
 * one test and zero failures — a worker that was OOM-killed or segfaulted
 * writes no junit and stays red. Any real `FAIL` line anywhere in the log also
 * keeps the run red, because junit's `failures` counter is per file and a
 * suite that died during collection can leave a file's totals at zero. And the
 * unhandled-error count vitest itself prints must equal the number of RPC
 * timeouts, so an unrelated unhandled error riding along in the same run is
 * never masked by them.
 *
 * The verdict is a warning, never silence: the pool being over capacity is the
 * actual defect, and a green job that hides it would remove the only pressure
 * to fix it (#10879).
