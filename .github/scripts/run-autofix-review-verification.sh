# charged to the round (package tests are A/B-exempt), which burned the
# 18-minute repair on a failure no repair can reach and ended the round as
# a timeout. Every git this script or its checks spawn (vitest fixture
# repos included) reads a per-run throwaway global config instead — seeded
# with the workspace safe.directory actions/checkout put in the real one —
# and no system config — any system-level git setting the checks ever
# come to depend on (a CA bundle, a proxy) must be replicated via per-job
# env, not /etc/gitconfig, because the redirect silently drops it. The
# redirect also keeps a branch-authored `git config --global` from writing
# durable state onto the host: it lands in the throwaway file and dies
# with the run. Enforcement is inherited-env only — branch code writing
# the real file directly bypasses it, which is why the PAT-bearing steps
# re-run resanitize-git-config.sh afterwards.
# Environment-carried config outranks BOTH file redirects and defeats
# every file-level guard: GIT_CONFIG_COUNT/_PARAMETERS carry config at
# command-line precedence, GIT_SSL_* / GIT_PROXY_COMMAND steer transport,
# GIT_EXEC_PATH swaps the transport-helper binary, GIT_DIR/GIT_WORK_TREE
# repoint git, GIT_ASKPASS/GIT_SSH* hijack auth/exec — branch code in an

# DID, not who asked for it. Two deterministic checks below (sensitive-area
# footprint here, the bite check after the package tests) plus one advisory
# (test deletion). All three read only git state and run before/around the
# existing deterministic re-checks.

# Sensitive-area footprint: a review round must not EXPAND into CI or
# verification machinery the PR itself was never about — a single review
# comment (any author) must not be able to alter the loop's own guardrails.
# Judged by AREA CLASS, not file: a PR whose own pre-round diff already
# touches a class (an infra PR under takeover) keeps full freedom there;
# a round reaching into a class the PR never touched is rejected. Retryable:
# the repair pass can revert the offending files in a follow-up commit.

# gate's every command resolves through them (`npm run build/typecheck/
# lint/test`) — a scripts edit can hollow out the gate while every check

# Bite check: run this round's changed tests against the PRE-ROUND tree
# (origin/<branch> sources + the round's test files). If EVERY changed test
# also passes there, the tests demonstrate nothing — the classic shape of a
# plausible-but-false finding implemented as a "fix" whose regression test
# was green all along.
#
# INTENT decides the consequence, and intent is read from the round's own
# machine-readable artifacts, not inferred from the diff shape: a round is
# a DEFECT-CLAIM round only when resolved-comments.txt marks a finding
# resolved-in-code whose thread is Critical-tagged or belongs to a
# CHANGES_REQUESTED review (matched in rc.json/rv.json). Those rounds get a
# non-retryable rejection on all-green — the 18-minute repair pass cannot
# make a nonexistent defect reproduce; the next full round re-reads the
# feedback with the evidence in LAST_REJECTION and can decline or escalate
# instead. Every OTHER src+test round (a refactor pinning existing
# behavior, an optional cleanup adding coverage) legitimately produces
# all-green pre-round tests, so all-green there is a gate-authored ADVISORY
# in the report, never a rejection.
# Scope guards (all fail OPEN — only the clean "ran and all passed" verdict
# has consequences):
#   - Runnable unit tests only: *.test.* / *.spec.* files. Snapshots and
#     integration-tests/ are not directly runnable here.
#   - Single-package rounds only: on the detached pre-round tree, gitignored
#     dist/ still carries the ROUND's build, so a cross-package fix leaks
#     into the baseline through dist-resolved imports and would read as
#     "no bite" — the same dist confound that A/B-exempts typecheck above.
#     Same-package imports resolve through vitest src aliases and relative
#     paths, which the detach does revert.
#   - A test that fails on the pre-round tree for ANY reason (assertion,
#     collection, import of a round-added symbol) counts as biting; the
#     check's power is the all-green case, which no honest defect fix
#     produces. KNOWN LIMIT, deliberate: the verdict is existential over
#     the batch, so in a mixed Critical round one genuinely biting test
#     vouches for the batch — binding each behavior to its own probe needs
#     per-test result parsing and is out of scope here. Also known: a
#     re-raised finding whose fix already sits in origin/<branch> is
#     legitimately all-green (SKILL directs re-verified items into
#     resolved-comments.txt); the rejection text tells the agent to
#     resolve such items in a no-code round of their own.
