/**
 * Reconcile injected mid-turn messages against the local pending queue: remove
 * the entry matching each injected message for `sessionId`, across ALL `batches`
 * (a multi-batch turn drains once per tool batch, so the consumer must process
 * every accumulated batch, not just the latest).
 *
 * Each injected message is matched in two passes. The first pass is a strict
 * `midTurnMessageId` match (the daemon mints an id at admission and echoes it on
 * injection); it wins regardless of array position, so two same-text sends can't
 * steal each other's removal when their admission responses arrive out of order.
 * Image rows are only matched here — the id proves the daemon owns them, while
 * a text comparison can't verify their attachments. File rows are never
 * matched — files are not pushed mid-turn, so they stay queued for the next
 * turn. Only when no id match exists does the second pass fall back to the
 * first text-only entry with matching text — any mid-turn row when the batch
 * carries no ids (older daemon), or a still-`submitting` row that hasn't
 * received its id yet. Matching stays count-based — one removal per injected
 * message — so a queue that holds the same text twice loses one entry per
 * matching injection. An entry that already fell back to the ordinary path
 * (`midTurnState === undefined`) is never matched.
 *
 * Text fallback skips batches from another originator so coincidentally equal
 * messages are not removed. In strict-id mode, an exact id still wins because
 * a refreshed client can adopt a session-wide daemon-owned row.
 *
 * Returns a NEW array when something was removed, or `null` when nothing matched
 * (so the caller can skip a redundant state update). `strictMessageIds`
 * disables the submitting-row text fallback for daemons that accept the
 * client-generated ids used by reconciliation; older daemons still need the
 * fallback because they mint their id after the request arrives.
