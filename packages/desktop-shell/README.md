# Qwen Code desktop shell

This package is an isolated Tauri 2 shell around the existing Web Shell. It does not contain a second UI.

## Runtime layout

`npm run build:runtime` prepares `runtime/qwen-code/` with:

- the current platform's Node.js runtime,
- the bundled `qwen` CLI,
- the built Web Shell under `lib/web-shell/`.

The Tauri app starts `qwen serve` on an ephemeral loopback port with a per-launch bearer token, waits for `/health`, and then opens that same daemon-served Web Shell in the native window.

Use **Settings → Daemon → Local Control** to temporarily share the live daemon with a phone on the same Wi-Fi. The Web Shell displays a QR code, keeps the computer awake while sharing is enabled, and closes the LAN listener when the user turns it off.

## Local development

From this directory:

```bash
npm install --workspaces=false
npm run build:runtime --workspaces=false
npm run dev --workspaces=false
```

The first two steps are one-time setup. After that, `npm run dev` is all you need.

`build:runtime` bundles the current platform's Node.js, the `qwen` CLI, and the built Web Shell into `runtime/qwen-code/`. Re-run it only when you change the CLI or Web Shell source.

Use `QWEN_DESKTOP_WORKSPACE=/absolute/path` to override the initial workspace. The app otherwise restores its saved primary workspace or creates `~/Documents/Qwen` on first launch. `QWEN_DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_DIR=/absolute/path` relocates that first-launch default, matching the Electron shell. Add and switch project workspaces from the Web Shell after startup.

## Debugging

### Runtime log

The daemon log is written to `~/Library/Logs/com.alibaba.qwen-code/desktop-runtime.log` on macOS. Tail it to see `qwen serve` output:

```bash
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/com.alibaba.qwen-code/desktop-runtime.log
```

The desktop state (saved workspace, window position) is stored in `~/Library/Application Support/com.alibaba.qwen-code/desktop-state.json`.

### WebView DevTools

Open the Web Shell's DevTools from the running window with `Cmd+Option+I` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux). This lets you inspect network requests, console output, and the React component tree.

### Environment variables

| Variable                     | Purpose                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `QWEN_DESKTOP_WORKSPACE`     | Override the initial workspace path                                 |
| `QWEN_DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_DIR` | Relocate the first-launch default workspace directory               |
| `QWEN_DESKTOP_SKIP_BUILD`    | Set to `1` to skip the CLI/Web Shell rebuild during `build:runtime` |
| `QWEN_CODE_ROOT`             | Point to a local qwen-code checkout for the runtime bundle          |

### Rust tests

```bash
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
```

## Releases

The `Desktop Release` workflow builds signed updater artifacts when `dry_run` is disabled. Published releases require the Tauri updater private key. macOS releases also require Apple signing and notarization credentials.

The first stable Tauri release may set `electron_bridge=true` to publish the macOS ZIPs and DMGs, Windows NSIS installer, Linux AppImage, and their Electron `0.0.5` manifests. Leave the input disabled for later releases; the fixed `desktop-latest` release retains the bridge assets while `desktop-latest.json` advances independently.

The macOS workflow accepts either the Tauri-era `APPLE_*` certificate and notarization secrets or the existing `MAC_CSC_*` and `APPLE_NOTARY_*` secrets. `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` must match the public key in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`.
