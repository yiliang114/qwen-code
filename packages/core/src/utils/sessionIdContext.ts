 * session per process, switched via `Config.startNewSession()`), but breaks
 * in daemon mode where one process hosts many concurrent sessions: only the
 * first `Config` ever claims the env slot (see `sessionEnvClaimed` in
 * config.ts), so shells spawned by every later session would read a stale
 * session ID.
 *
 * Daemon-style hosts should wrap each session's execution entry points in
 * `sessionIdContext.run(sessionId, ...)`. `getShellContextEnvVars()` prefers
 * this context over `process.env`, falling back to the env var so the
