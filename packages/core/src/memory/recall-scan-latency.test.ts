/**
 * Measures the part of the initial-turn budget nothing else measures.
 *
 * `recall-delivery-eval.test.ts` times the deterministic *scoring*, which is
 * microseconds. That is not what decides whether the fast path delivers. The
 * fast result is published from `onFastResult`, which fires only after recall
 * has enumerated, read, and parsed every topic file — and this branch removed
 * the 200-document cap for recall, so that scan grows with the memory tree.
 * If the scan alone exceeds `INITIAL_MEMORY_RECALL_WAIT_MS`, the turn pays the
 * full budget *and* delivers nothing, which is strictly worse than before.
 *
 * So this file measures wall-clock time from the recall call to the fast
 * callback, against a real temporary memory tree, with the model selector
 * mocked to hang the way a network round trip does.
 *
 * Timings are machine-dependent and CI is shared, so the assertions are
 * deliberately loose; the printed table is the artifact worth reading. What
 * is asserted is the structural claim: the fast result lands well inside the
 * budget at memory-tree sizes users can plausibly reach.
