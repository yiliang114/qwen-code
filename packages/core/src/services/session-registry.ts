/**
 * An index of the Qwen Code sessions that are running right now.
 *
 * Each top-level session writes `<global dir>/sessions/<pid>.json` at
 * startup and unlinks it on exit. The directory is flat and keyed by PID
 * so that "who else is running" is one `readdir` plus a handful of small
 * reads.
 *
 * The index is scoped to one Qwen home: the global dir resolves
 * `QWEN_HOME` on every call, so a session started under a redirected
 * `QWEN_HOME` registers elsewhere and stays invisible to readers under
 * the default home (and vice versa). It also assumes a single machine on
 * platforms without a start token: there, no identity separates two
 * machines sharing one home, so the registry does not support that.
 *
 * ## Why this is not `runtime.json`
 *
 * {@link ../utils/runtimeStatus.ts} already writes a per-session sidecar,
 * but it answers a different question and cannot serve this one:
 *
 * - It lives at `<projectDir>/chats/<sessionId>.runtime.json`, so it is
 *   indexed by session id rather than by liveness. `isSessionRuntimeActive`
 *   in `worktreeSessionService.ts` shows what the reverse lookup costs
 *   there: candidate runtime-base guessing plus a recursive scan, to
 *   answer the question for a *single already-known* session id.
 * - It is deliberately never deleted — not on clean quit, not on crash —
 *   so presence carries no liveness signal at all.
 *
 * The two coexist: `runtime.json` stays the stable, kimi-compatible
 * "which session is PID X serving" sidecar for external observers, and
 * this registry is the discovery index for the CLI's own features.
 *
 * ## Staleness
 *
 * A record is live when it was written from the reader's own PID
 * namespace and boot, its PID is running *and* the recorded process
 * start token still matches (see `isSameProcess`) — a recycled PID must
 * not resurrect a dead session. Records that fail the liveness check are
 * swept during enumeration; records from another PID namespace — or from
 * another machine's boot, which the namespace inode alone does not
 * separate, because the initial namespace inode is a kernel constant
 * identical on every Linux machine — are neither listed nor swept,
 * because PID numbers do not resolve across those boundaries in either
 * direction. The same isolation extends to records whose writer's
 * namespace no longer exists (an ephemeral container destroyed without
 * cleanup): no future reader shares that namespace, so the record is
 * never reclaimed and stays until removed by hand. Anything else we
 * cannot positively prove dead is left alone.
 *
 * One consequence of the boot prefix being the only machine identity: it
 * does not survive a reboot, and the model has no reboot-surviving
 * machine component to pair it with, so this machine's own records from
 * a PREVIOUS boot — provably dead, since a boot ending kills every
 * process in it — are indistinguishable from another machine's live
 * records. Both conservative rules above therefore also strand them: a
 * hard reset (power loss, panic, kill -9 plus reboot) leaves a record
 * nothing ever reclaims, and a later session that draws the same PID
 * number is refused by registration on the boot mismatch and stays
 * undiscoverable until the file is removed by hand.
