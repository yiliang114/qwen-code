 *
 * Full-snapshot reads above this cap are refused with `file_too_large`
 * rather than truncated. `readText` can serve finite-limit line windows from
 * larger files, but the default read/edit contract still needs a bounded
 * snapshot for hash stability, SSE buffering, and oldText matching. Files at
 * or below the cap honor a tighter `opts.maxBytes` as a post-decode UTF-8
 * output cap; `enforceReadSize` also supplies source-size truncation metadata.
 *
 * `edit()` uses the same constant as a hard upper bound.
 * `readBytesWindow` instead binds an fd and returns at most its explicit
 * byte window without buffering the whole file. `enforceReadBytesSize`
 * remains available to strict callers that do require a full byte snapshot.
