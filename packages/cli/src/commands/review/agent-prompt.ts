// `qwen review agent-prompt`: build a review agent's launch prompt in code.
//
// The prompt used to be composed by the orchestrator, from a paragraph of the
// skill's instructions telling it what to include. Measured against the harness's
// own record of what the agents were actually launched with — the first record of
// each subagent transcript, written at launch and not retconnable — the
// orchestrator did not include it:
//
//   23 of 23 chunk agents were launched with a prompt that named NO diff file:
//   no `diffPathAbsolute`, no `read_file`, no offset, no limit. All 23 made zero
//   tool calls.
//
// They were handed a *description* of a chunk they had no way to open ("The
// changes are in chunk 13 of 23, covering lines 3808-4024 of the diff"), and a
// sentence to say if they found nothing ("If you find no issues, say 'No issues
// found — reviewed chunk 13 (...)'"). They said it. Every one of them.
//
// So the agents never whiffed. They were launched blind, and then dutifully read
// their line. The receipts they returned — which looked like proof of work — were
// in the prompt that launched them.
//
// This is the same failure this skill has now fixed five times over: a rule the
// prompt states in prose is a rule that will eventually not be followed, and the
// fix is always to move it into code that can say no. It was applied to the
// review target, the posting gate, the verdict, and the coverage report. The
// agent's own prompt — the thing that decides whether a review can happen at all
// — was the one place it was not.
//
// The orchestrator now asks for the prompt instead of writing it. What comes back
// carries the diff path, the agent's exact byte range, and the paging and
// uncoverable rules, because those are not things a caller should be trusted to
// remember.

 */
const SEVERITY = `Apply the severity definitions. **Severity describes the code, not your feelings about the finding.**
- **Critical** — the code does something wrong. A bug that produces incorrect behaviour, a security hole, data loss, a resource or state leak, a build or test failure. Not "important", not "large", not "I am confident": *wrong*.
- **Suggestion** — a recommended improvement to code that works.
- **Nice to have** — optional.

**A missing test is a Suggestion.** Absent code that does something wrong, nothing is broken, and "this file has zero references to \`X\`" is a coverage statistic, not a defect. Two shapes ARE Critical, because in both of them something *is* wrong: a test that asserts the **opposite** of the intended behaviour (it will bless the very regression it was written to catch), and a test **weakened, disabled or deleted in this diff** so that new behaviour passes. If a missing test would let a specific incorrect behaviour ship, report **that behaviour** as the Critical and cite the missing test as your evidence — naming the bug is the work; naming the gap is not.

An inflated severity blocks a merge: the verdict is computed from Criticals alone. Measured on one run of this skill, four "zero test coverage" findings were filed as Critical and two identical ones as Suggestion, in the same review, and the pull request was blocked partly on the strength of the four.`;

/**
 * The finding format, and the rules that make an anchor resolvable.
 *
 * The anchor rules used to live only in the skill — in a section addressed to the
 * orchestrator, which the agents never see. So the agents were asked for an anchor
 * and never told what makes one work: prefer the added lines, a removed line cannot
 * be anchored at all, and one lonely `}` matches everywhere. `resolve-anchors` is
 * downstream of a snippet it was never given the rules to produce.
 */
const FINDING_FORMAT = `Format each finding using this structure:
- **File:** <file path>:<line number or range>
- **Anchor:** <1-3 consecutive lines copied VERBATIM from the diff — the code this finding is about>
- **Source:** [review]
- **Issue:** <one-line statement of the defect>
- **Failure scenario:** <the concrete trigger and the concrete wrong outcome: what input, state, timing, or config makes this code misbehave, and what incorrect output / crash / leak / exposure results>
- **Suggested fix:** <concrete code suggestion when possible, or "N/A">
- **Severity:** Critical | Suggestion | Nice to have
- **Confidence:** high | low

**The anchor is what places the comment, not the line number.** The line is computed from your snippet downstream; a bad snippet lands a real blocker on unrelated code, or gets it dropped. So:

- Copy it **verbatim** from the diff, indentation included. Strip the leading \`+\`.
- Prefer **added (\`+\`) lines** — that is what a review comments on. An unchanged context line inside a hunk resolves too. A **removed (\`-\`) line does not**: deleted code has no line on the side a comment can attach to. To comment on a deletion, anchor on the line that *replaced* it.
- Give **enough lines to be unique**. A bare \`}\` or \`});\` appears everywhere in the file and will resolve to whichever one happens to be nearest. Two or three lines are almost always unique; one distinctive line is fine.
- A finding about a file this diff does **not** touch — a docs page or a caller the change falsifies — cannot anchor there: a comment attaches only to files the PR changes. Quote the diff line that creates the problem, and name the affected file in **Issue**.
- A line too long to quote whole — a multi-KB single-line Markdown paragraph — may be quoted as a distinctive verbatim **fragment** of at least 12 characters (measured after whitespace collapse); it resolves to the line containing it.
- Fill in **File** and the line number anyway. The path selects the file and the line breaks a tie when the snippet genuinely repeats. Neither is trusted as the answer.

**The failure scenario is the finding's evidence, and it gates reporting.** For a quality finding, state the concrete cost instead of a crash — what is duplicated, wasted, or made harder to change — or quote the rule it violates. A **Suggestion** or **Nice to have** whose failure scenario you cannot fill in concretely **is not a finding: do not report it.** A suspected **Critical** whose trigger you cannot pin down IS still reported, at \`Confidence: low\`, with the scenario naming the mechanism and what remains uncertain — a later verification stage rules on it. "This looks risky", with no nameable trigger and no nameable cost, is how a hallucinated finding reaches a pull request.`;

/**
 * What not to report.
 *
 * These are the skill's Exclusion Criteria, and **they had never reached an agent.**
 * The skill states them at the end of the document and tells the orchestrator to
 * "apply the Exclusion Criteria" — but the agents do not read the document; they
 * read the prompt they are launched with, and the orchestrator composed those from
 * memory. So the single largest precision control in this review has been governing
 * nobody, in every run, since it was written.
 */
const EXCLUSIONS = `## What is NOT a finding

Do not report anything that matches these. Silence is better than noise — but a silently dropped **Critical** is neither, and it is unrecoverable, because no later stage ever sees it.

- **Pre-existing issues in unchanged code.** Review the diff. A defect entirely in code this change does not touch is out of scope, unless this change is what makes it newly reachable or newly wrong — in which case report it as an effect of this diff.
- **Style or formatting a formatter would auto-normalize**, and naming that matches the surrounding conventions. But a substantive issue a linter or type checker would flag — an unused variable, unreachable code, a type error — IS in scope, even where the surrounding code tolerates it.
- **Pedantic nitpicks** a senior engineer would not raise, and subjective "consider doing X" that names no real problem.
- **A Suggestion or Nice-to-have with no concrete failure scenario** — no nameable trigger, no nameable cost. (A suspected Critical in that state is reported at \`Confidence: low\` instead of dropped.)
- **A description of what the diff does, filed as a finding.** If your Suggested fix reads \`N/A (already implemented)\`, or the Issue praises the change instead of naming something wrong with it, that is a changelog entry. Drop it. Every finding must be something the author should **do**. A review of a good pull request is allowed to be empty, and an empty review is more useful than a padded one — dogfooded, one run reported five "Suggestions" that each summarised something the pull request already did, and the reader had to read all five to discover there was nothing to do.
- **If you are unsure whether a Suggestion or Nice to have is a problem, do not report it.** This does **not** apply to a suspected Critical.
- Minor refactors that address no real problem; missing documentation unless the logic is genuinely confusing; "best practice" citations that point to no concrete bug or risk.
- Issues already discussed in the pull request's existing comments.`;

/**
 * The counterweight to the Exclusion Criteria, aimed at the one failure they
 * cannot see: a finder that had the defect and did not file it.
 *
 * The exclusions above are a filter on *what kind of thing* is a finding. Read as
 * a confidence threshold — which is how a finder under instruction to prefer
 * silence reads them — they become a licence to drop anything half-believed, and
 * that drop is invisible: no later stage sees a candidate that was never filed,
 * so a suppressed defect is indistinguishable from a clean diff for the rest of
 * the run. Every downstream stage this skill has (dedup, Step 4 verification,
 * the reverse audit, the confidence split that keeps low-confidence findings out
 * of the pull request) exists to remove wrong findings. None of them can add a
 * missing one.
 *
 * So the split is stated explicitly here rather than left to be inferred: the
 * scenario gate stays (no nameable trigger and no nameable cost is still not a
 * finding), and uncertainty about whether a *nameable* defect is worth raising
 * stops being grounds to drop it.
 */
const RECALL = `## Do not silently drop a candidate

The exclusions above say what **kind of thing** is not a finding. They are not a confidence bar, and you must not read them as one.

- **File every candidate whose failure scenario you can name.** If you can state the trigger and the wrong outcome, report it — at \`Confidence: low\` if you are unsure it is real. A finder that quietly withholds half-believed candidates is the single largest source of missed defects in this pipeline, and the loss is unrecoverable: every stage after you can *remove* a wrong finding, and none of them can *add* one you never filed.
- **Do not suppress on another agent's account.** Other lenses are walking this diff too. You do not know what they filed, "someone else will probably catch it" is not a reason to stay silent, and two agents flagging the same line for **different** reasons is signal, not duplication — deduplication happens downstream, and it merges on the defect, not on the line.
- **Do not let one thing you concluded silence the next.** Deciding a hunk is fine on one axis says nothing about the others. Finish the walk your dimension defines.

What this does **not** license: a finding with no nameable trigger and no nameable cost is still not a finding, and padding a thin review with restatements of what the diff does is still noise. This rule adds candidates you can justify; it does not lower what justifies one.`;
