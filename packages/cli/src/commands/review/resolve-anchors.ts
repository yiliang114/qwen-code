// `qwen review resolve-anchors`: turn each finding's quoted code snippet into
// the line number GitHub needs, by matching it against the captured diff.
//
// Step 7 used to post the line number the review agent reported. GitHub rejects
// the entire Create Review call with a 422 if any one comment's line falls
// outside every hunk of its file — all-or-nothing — so a single miscounted
// anchor took every Critical in the review down with it, and the recovery path
// then *discarded* unanchorable Suggestions from the PR. This makes the number
// a computed value: the agent quotes the code (which it can see), the diff
// decides the line (which it cannot miscount).
