// `qwen review plan-diff`: partition an already-captured diff file into review
// chunks and emit the same plan `fetch-pr` emits.
//
// Step 3B's chunk agents are defined as "one per entry in `chunks[]`", and only
// `fetch-pr` produced a chunk plan. A local-diff review, or a cross-repo review
// in lightweight mode, therefore routed into a topology it had no chunk list
// for — no receipts, no tiling guarantee, and the orchestrator left to improvise
// line ranges. Those two paths now capture their diff to a file (redirection
// bypasses Shell model-output truncation) and run this.
