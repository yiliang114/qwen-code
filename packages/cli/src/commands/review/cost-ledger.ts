// `qwen review cost-ledger`: what this review actually cost, from the
// harness's own usage records.
//
// The number exists because it kept having to be excavated. A maintainer's
// "0.21.3 was fine, 0.21.4 got slow" was settled only by replaying a whole
// review under a telemetry exporter and hand-aggregating half a million
// telemetry lines — hours of forensics for a question one printed table
// answers. The same excavation found the money: a small +93/-48 PR at high
// effort cost 523 model calls and 37.8M input tokens, 9.7M of them a repair
// round redelivering prompts the agents had already acted on. Nobody chose
// that spend; nobody could see it either.
//
// The data was on disk the whole time: every chat and subagent transcript
// event carries `usageMetadata` (prompt / candidates / thoughts / cached
// counts). This subcommand aggregates those records — the same records
// `check-coverage` trusts for delivery, read from the same
// environment-exported location — into per-stream totals. It is
// **informational**: a ledger that cannot be computed prints why and exits 0,
// because a review must never fail on its own accounting.
//
// A "model call" is an assistant record carrying `usageMetadata`; a turn
// whose provider returned no usage is invisible, so call counts are a floor,
// not an exact API-call tally.
