// `qwen review match-remote`: which local git remote serves a PR's
// owner/repo. Step 1 of /review needs this twice — to decide whether a
// `pr-url` target gets the worktree flow or lightweight mode, and to pick
// the fetch remote for a bare PR number — and the rule used to live in the
// prompt as prose, where it shipped a substring match (review one repo, post
// to another) and hand-guessed remotes. The rule is now exact-segment
// equality, tested here, and the orchestrator only relays the outcome.
//
// Outcomes: exactly one matching remote — its name on stdout, exit 0. No
// match — `none` on stdout, exit 6 (the lightweight-mode signal). Several —
// every name on stdout, exit 7; picking among them is not this command's
// call, and the review stops rather than guesses (the same rule the prose
// had). 7, not 2 — 2 stays reserved for shell-level misuse, like run's
// 3-not-2 choice. Not a git repository, or git unavailable — exit 1, fail
// closed like the other gates.
