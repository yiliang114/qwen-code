// `qwen review capture-local`: capture the working tree's diff — staged,
// unstaged, and untracked — and partition it into review chunks, in one pass.
// The local counterpart of `fetch-pr`.
//
// This used to be a `git diff` command line typed out in the skill prompt, with
// ten flags to pin and a redirect to dodge Shell model-output truncation. Two things
// were wrong with that. The flags drifted from the ones `fetch-pr` pins (they
// now live in `lib/diff-flags.ts`, shared). And the command it told the model to
// run — `git diff HEAD` — cannot see an untracked file, so every brand-new file
// in the working tree went unreviewed and a working tree whose only change was a
// new file reported "no changes to review".
