// `qwen review submit`: the only thing in this skill that writes to a pull
// request.
//
// Step 7 has always opened with a posting gate — "posting is a public,
// irreversible write, so it happens ONLY on an explicit instruction" — written
// as prose, and prose is not a gate. It has now failed twice in dogfooding. The
// second time was this skill reviewing its own pull request: no `--comment`, no
// publish request, and it filed a public COMMENT review anyway. Both times the
// model did not decide to defy the rule; it reasoned its way to a verdict it
// wanted to file and never re-read the sentence forbidding the filing.
//
// The skill already learned this once. The review event and body used to be
// reasoned about at submit time and got it wrong five times running, so they
// became `compose-review` — a subcommand that computes them. **Whether to write
// at all** is the same kind of decision, and the authorisation is already a
// computed fact: `parse-args` emits `comment.effective` in Step 1. Nothing was
// missing but a piece of code willing to say no.
//
// So the write lives here, behind that fact. A model that wants to post must ask
// something that checks.
//
// **And the verdict is no longer an input.** For a while, `compose-review`
// computed the event and the body and the skill then told the orchestrator to
// "copy event/body verbatim into the review JSON" — a transcription, into a
// document the model writes, of a decision the CLI had already made. That is the
// exact shape this file's own comment repudiates two paragraphs up, and it is the
// shape that has failed at every layer of this skill. Dogfooded, one run went
// further and skipped `compose-review` altogether: it read the coverage check's
// refusal, decided "the agents clearly did their job", and printed an **Approve it
// had written itself**.
//
// So `submit` composes. What it takes is the *findings* — the inline comments and
// the states Step 6 established — and it derives everything that follows from
// them, including how many blockers there are, by counting the comments actually
// attached rather than believing a number typed beside them. There is no `event`
// field to forge and no `body` field to write, and a payload that carries one is
// refused: the caller was trying to author a verdict, and the verdict is not the
// caller's.

  //    refuses, whatever the environment resolves.
  //  - Recorded non-Aone target (pr-url host binding) must NOT be vetoed
  //    by the cwd probe from an Aone-origin clone — the recorded binding
  //    is the explicit signal the registry's precedence documents.
  //  - RECORDED but hostless (a bare-MR-number recording with no `--host`
  //    flag — the canonical Aone invocation shape carries no URL): the
  //    recording proves a review exists but not WHERE it lives, and the
  //    runtime environment cannot prove it either. For a public,
  //    irreversible write that is fail-CLOSED: refuse and name the remedy
  //    (`--host`), instead of trusting the environment and posting the
  //    review at github.com's same-named repo.
  //  - No recording at all: fall back to the flag, then GH_HOST (ghEnv
  //    inherits the operator's export when no module host is set, so an
  //    Aone-pointing GH_HOST must hit this refusal, not an opaque gh
