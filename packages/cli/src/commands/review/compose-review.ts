// `qwen review compose-review`: deterministic event selection and body
// composition for the /review skill's Step 7 submission.
//
// This logic used to be prose — a C/S table, three event-capping overrides,
// a seven-clause body composition, and presubmit downgrade carve-outs,
// restated across four places in SKILL.md. Keeping the restatements in sync
// by hand produced five shipped bugs (four Critical), all of the same shape:
// one downstream branch not updated when an upstream rule gained a new
// state. This module is the single source of truth; the skill gathers the
// state, calls it, and uses `{event, body}` verbatim. 422 recovery is the
// same call with the updated `--comments` file — the counts are counted
// from it, never updated by hand.
//
// The model stays responsible for judgment (what is a Critical, is it
// real); this owns only the bookkeeping that follows from the counts.
