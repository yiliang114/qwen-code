// What `agent-prompt` handed out, written down by the thing that handed it out.
//
// `agent-prompt` exists because the orchestrator, told in prose to include the
// diff path in every chunk agent's prompt, did not: 23 of 23 real chunk agents
// were launched with a prompt that named no diff file. So the prompt moved into
// code. Dogfooding the fix, the command was invoked correctly for all five
// chunks — and the orchestrator then **rewrote what it printed** before launching
// the agents. Measured against the harness's transcript of chunk 1, the delivered
// prompt had dropped the instruction not to recite a stock sentence, dropped the
// warning about half-read ranges, and replaced the project's review rules with a
// three-sentence summary of its own. It had also invented an instruction that was
// never in the original.
//
// The prompt was built in code and then edited on the way to the agent, and
// nothing could see it, because the only check on a launch prompt was "does it
// contain the diff path" — and a paraphrase keeps the path.
//
// So the builder now records what it emitted, at a path derived from the plan.
// The caller is never given that path and is never asked to write anything there;
// the check reads it back and compares it to what the harness recorded as the
// agent's actual launch prompt. The two artifacts have different authors, and
// neither is the orchestrator.
