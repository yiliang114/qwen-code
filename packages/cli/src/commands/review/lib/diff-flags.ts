// The flags every /review diff capture pins, in one place.
//
// Two capture paths produce the diff the whole review reads: `fetch-pr` (a PR's
// merge-base..head) and `capture-local` (the working tree). They must pin the
// same knobs, because the parser downstream is the same and a diff that parses
// under one and not the other is a coverage hole nobody sees — `plan-diff`
// would simply report fewer chunks. Keeping the list in two places invites
// exactly that drift, so it lives here.

/**
 * Config overrides that have no command-line equivalent.
 *
 * `diff.suppressBlankEmpty`: with it set, git prints a blank context line as a
 * physically empty record rather than a lone space, and the parser's new-side
 * cursor must know which it is getting.
 *
 * `core.quotePath=false`: git's DEFAULT is to C-style-quote any path with a
 * non-ASCII byte — `"docs/\\346\\236\\266\\346\\236\\204.md"`. Nothing
 * downstream is broken by that on its own; `parseDiff` unquotes, so the chunk
 * plan and the containment oracle name such a path correctly either way. The
 * pin is about there being ONE shape rather than two: it is the capture, not
 * each reader, that decides how a path is spelled, so a consumer that reads
 * the raw diff text — or a new one written against the unquoted form, which is
 * what every existing reader assumes — cannot be silently wrong for the subset
 * of repositories that have a non-ASCII filename.

 * `i/`/`w/`, which `stripPrefix` does not know. `diff.context` changes how many
 * lines each hunk carries. `diff.renames=false` reports a move as delete + add.
 * `diff.relative` strips the repo prefix from every path when git runs from a
 * subdirectory. `diff.ignoreSubmodules=all` hides a changed gitlink entirely,
 * and `diff.submodule=log` replaces the whole section with prose.
