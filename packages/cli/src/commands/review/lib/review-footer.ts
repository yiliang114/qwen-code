 * marker: a quoted or truncated forged footer is the natural output of the
 * model loop this strip exists for, and the replace still ran the unanchored
 * search over the whole body when no trailing footer matched (probe-measured
 * ~4× per doubling of the whitespace run). So the replace runs only over the
 * last STRIP_TAIL_LIMIT characters — the regex is `$`-anchored, so a match
 * can only live at the tail, and one footer is ~40 characters, which bounds
 * the strip to a few hundred accumulated footers, far past any real
 * re-compose loop. Bounding at the last marker occurrence does NOT work: the
 * whitespace run sits after the last marker line and stays inside that
 * bound. Shared by both strip sites — `compose-review`'s drafted entries and
 * `submit`'s inline comments — because one guard is one guard, and a second
