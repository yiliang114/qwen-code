// The reverse-audit loop's clock.
//
// The iterative reverse audit (Step 5) is the one stage of a review whose cost
// is open-ended: each round is a fan-out (one auditor per chunk on a 3B plan),
// each round's findings go back through verification, and the loop runs until
// two consecutive dry rounds or the plan's round cap (one value per topology:
// 10 on a 3A diff, 5 on a 3B one, and 3 when huge — but only where a deadline
// exists, since that reduction answers a ceiling; 5 when huge without one). On a PR where every round
// finds something, that is the whole budget. Measured on a real CI run
// (#8368, +1699 lines): the audit loop ran to the 5-round cap, consumed 3.5 of
// the job's 4 budgeted hours, and the outer GNU-timeout kill arrived while
// round 5's findings were still being verified — the review died holding
// every confirmed finding it had, and nothing reached the pull request.
//
// So a time-budgeted run tells the CLI its deadline, and the round *builder*
// refuses to start a round that no longer fits. Two quantities have to fit,
// not one: the tail (the last verification, compose-review, submission — the
// reserve) AND the round being admitted, whose cost the gate now measures
// instead of guessing — the loop's terminal round is by construction the one
// that starts closest to the boundary, so a gate that admits a round on the
// reserve alone re-creates the killed-mid-verification failure one round wide.
// Each admission is stamped on disk; the next admission reads the previous
// stamp and uses the observed round cost, falling back to a conservative
// constant for round 1 (which starts with the most headroom).
//
// The refusal is deterministic twice over: the builder exits 4 with no prompt
// built (there is no round to launch without it), and a `budget-stop.json`
// marker is written beside the prompt records so `compose-review` synthesizes
// the verdict-capping disclosure itself — the orchestrator's copy of the
// entry is a courtesy to the terminal reader, not the mechanism.
//
// A run with no deadline in its environment — every local run — is untouched.
// A malformed deadline fails OPEN (the gate stays silent): the outer kill
// still bounds the run, and a broken environment variable must degrade to
// today's behaviour, not wedge every budgeted review at round 1.

 * What must still fit after the last reverse-audit round completes: the

 *
 * Under the pipelined loop (SKILL.md Step 5), a round's verification
 * launches WITH the next round's auditors instead of sitting between
 * admissions — so the admission-to-admission span the gate measures
 * contains no verification pass, and the terminal round's verification has
 * exactly one cover: this reserve. That makes the reserve's sizing the
 * whole margin, not a top-up on an overlap the measurement already
 * carried — so the estimate refuses to be optimistic too: it prices the
 * round from the COSTLIEST span the run has measured (see
 * `expectedRoundSeconds`), because round costs do not climb smoothly —
 * each round re-reads the diff against a longer findings list, and a
 * repair relaunch lands mid-loop and makes one round the expensive one —
 * and the newest span alone under-predicts the next in exactly the runs
 * that end near the boundary. Over-reserving ends the loop at most one
 * round early, disclosed as a budget stop; under-reserving is #8368 —
 * killed mid-verification, holding every confirmed finding.
 *
 * Sized from the only tail measurement the record holds (#8368, +1699
 * lines): the loop ended with half an hour left and the outer kill found
 * round 5's verification STILL RUNNING — the tail had consumed more than 30
 * minutes and was nowhere through (compose, anchor resolution and
 * submission never started). No upper bound was ever measured, so the size
 * is insurance, not arithmetic: pipelining made this reserve the terminal
 * round's ONLY cover, and until pipelined runs measure their tails, the
 * reserve buys the unknown, not the known. Over-reserving ends the loop at
 * most one round early, disclosed as a budget stop; under-reserving is
 * #8368.
 *
 * This is only the fallback: the budget itself is
 * chosen outside the CLI (a repository variable, a workflow input, a
 * `/review --timeout=N` comment), so the review workflow passes a reserve
 * scaled to the budget it resolved rather than trusting this constant to fit
 * an arbitrary one. The workflow caps that scaled reserve at this same
 * number (`.github/workflows/qwen-code-pr-review.yml`) — keep the two in
 * sync. A local run has no deadline and no reserve at all.

 *
 * A distinct, smaller floor exists because the two costs fail differently.
 * A round's verification scales with its finding count and — on a security
 * PR whose findings are shell/git bypasses re-checked with real filesystem
 * E2E — with the per-finding cost, without bound; compose-review is one CLI
 * call and the submission a handful of `gh` calls, both bounded. So the

 * VERIFIER on this floor: below it, no verify shard is built, the
 * findings in hand keep their `— [unverified]` tag (compose-review caps the
 * verdict on it), and compose still runs. Measured: PR #8687, a 4 269-line
 * cross-worktree git guard, ran the audit to a correct budget stop with
 * ~110 minutes left, then a single hand-rolled re-verification agent
 * re-running a 15-family bypass battery with real bash+git consumed all of
 * it — the wall hit mid-verification, compose never ran, and ~20
 * E2E-confirmed Critical bypasses were never posted. Twenty minutes is
 * insurance sized like the reserve, not arithmetic: compose + anchor
 * resolution + submit has no measured upper bound, and over-reserving only
 * ends verification a shard early, disclosed as an unverified tag.
