// Review-platform abstraction: the operations the /review skill needs from a
// code-review host, with the host's API shape kept behind the boundary.
//
// Introduced with a single provider (GitHub) together with its first real
// consumers — the meta / issue-context / fetch-diff / comment-body
// subcommands, which absorb the `gh` commands that used to live in the
// skill's prompt prose. The boundary exists so a second provider (Aone Code)
// lands without the skill prose or these subcommands changing; see
// docs/design/2026-08-13-review-platform-provider-abstraction.md.
