// Per-chunk retirement for the Step 5 reverse-audit loop.
//
// On a 3B plan the loop launches one auditor PER CHUNK PER ROUND, up to five
// rounds. Measured on a real run (6 chunks × 5 rounds = 30 auditors, ~95
// minutes): chunks 3 and 6 came back dry in ALL five rounds, while chunks 1,
// 2 and 4 yielded in most of them. The loop's convergence rule is
// round-global — two consecutive dry ROUNDS — so one hot territory keeps
// every cold one under audit for the whole run: auditor after auditor
// re-walking code that has twice produced a substantive all-clear, on
// exactly the large reviews where the rounds they pad push the loop into the
// budget gate.
//
// So from round 3 on the schedule becomes per-chunk. A chunk whose two most
// recent audits are both substantive dry receipts is RETIRED: instead of an
// auditor every round it gets a cold check on alternating rounds, and a cold
// check that yields puts it straight back on the every-round schedule.
// Rounds 1 and 2 always fan out to every chunk — they are what establishes
// each chunk's record.
//
// The history this is read from is the same pair of artifacts every delivery
// check trusts: the prompts this CLI recorded itself building (keyed
// `reverse-audit--chunk-<n>--round-<k>--<digest>`) and the harness's own
// transcripts of the agents launched with them. Nothing the orchestrator
// writes is consulted — a schedule the subject of the checks could edit is a
// schedule that retires whatever chunk is inconvenient to audit.
//
// Everything here fails toward auditing, chunk by chunk: no transcripts, no
// matching transcript, a whiffed receipt, an unclassifiable return — each
// reads as "not dry", and a chunk that cannot prove itself cold stays hot.
// The failure mode of a bug in this file is the old behaviour (audit every
// territory every round), never a skipped one. Since #9206 the failure is
// also not SILENT: a chunk whose two most recent audits neither retired it
// nor proved it hot carries a `diagnostics` line naming the bar each round
// fell at, so a never-retiring loop is diagnosable from the round's own
// output instead of from evidence cleanup was about to destroy.
