// Resolve a review finding's location from a **code snippet** instead of
// trusting a line number the model counted out by hand.
//
// The old contract asked each review agent for `<file>:<line>`. A line number
// is not something an agent reads; it is something it *derives*, by counting
// hunk headers and `+` lines across a diff it is paging through 25 000
// characters at a time. Agents miscount. GitHub then answers the whole Create
// Review call with a 422 — all-or-nothing, so one bad anchor sank every finding
// in the review, Criticals included — and the recovery path dropped the
// offender: an unanchorable Suggestion was discarded from the PR outright.
// Findings that were *correct about the code* were being thrown away because
// the model was wrong about arithmetic.
//
// So the agent now quotes the line instead of numbering it — a verbatim copy of
// what it is commenting on, which is the one thing it demonstrably has in front
// of it — and the number is computed here, from the diff, by consecutive-line
// matching. It is the same move `compose-review` made for the verdict: the part
// a model reasons about badly becomes the part a subcommand computes.
//
// Because every candidate line is collected from **inside a hunk**, a resolved
// anchor is a valid GitHub anchor by construction. The 422 class this module
// replaces cannot be reached from a `resolved` result.
