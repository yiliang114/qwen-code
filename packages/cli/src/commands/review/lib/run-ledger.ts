// Which CLI sessions this review ran under, written by the thing that ran them.
//
// A review interrupted mid-run and resumed (`--resume`) continues in a NEW CLI
// session: the harness keys its subagent transcripts on `QWEN_CODE_SESSION_ID`,
// so the first attempt's evidence sits in a directory the second attempt's
// environment no longer names. The readers that certify agent work (coverage,
// retirement, the recovery command) need the earlier directory's name — and the
// orchestrator must not be the one to supply it, for the same reason it is never
// given the prompt-record path: a path the model can choose is a path the model
// can point somewhere flattering.
//
// So `fetch-pr` appends its own session id here, read back later from disk. The
// entry is only ever an ADDRESS, never a verdict. For the CERTIFYING readers
// a fabricated id can at most point at a directory inside the harness's own
// `subagents/` tree, where credit still requires the content-shaped pairing
// (verbatim-delivered prompt, opened brief, diff reads) that fabrication
// cannot satisfy. Two consumers sit outside that sentence, deliberately: ids
// also address `chats/<id>.jsonl`, and the COST ledger folds a session's
// usage with no pairing at all — a forged id there can inflate a number the
// review reports about itself, never a verdict it certifies about the code.
// Cost is accounting, not evidence, and the honest claim stops there.
//
// The same file's sibling, `resume.json`, is the resume/restart bookkeeping the
// skill used to hold only in transcript memory: how many times this review has
// resumed, and whether it already restarted once for head movement.
