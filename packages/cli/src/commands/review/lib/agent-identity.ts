// The identity line `agent-prompt` bakes into every launch it builds —
// `You are review agent `<role>` — <label>[ (round N)].[ Your file: `<path>`.]`
// — and the ONE parser for it. Two independent copies existed (cost-ledger's
// row labels and coverage's disclosure labels), which is how the format and
// its readers drift apart: when the builder changes and a copy is missed,
// that reader silently falls back to first-line prose.
//
// What each caller decides for itself is WHICH line to feed the parser.
// cost-ledger trusts only the prompt's first line (the text below can QUOTE
// other agents' identity lines, and a whole-launch match would hand the
// quoted label to the agent carrying the quote); coverage scans for the
// first line-anchored identity line, because orchestrators prepend context
// lines to the launches they write (measured: twelve finders shared one
// PR-summary first line, and every disclosure rendered the same PR quote).

/**
 * A role that IS a chunk assignment — `chunk 3 of 7` — labels as its id.
 * The shape matches coverage's `CHUNK_RE` (whitespace-tolerant,
 * case-insensitive) so both readers resolve the same role the same way; a
 * hand-edited `Chunk 3 of 7` used to resolve as a chunk owner in the posted
 * body and a role agent in the ledger row. Anchored, because here the whole
 * role slot is the candidate, not a substring of a prompt.
