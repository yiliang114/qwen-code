// The deterministic layer-coverage cap for the reverse audit.
//
// A modeled executable system — a shell/git guard, a sandbox, a permission
// interpreter — has defect LAYERS a "two dry rounds" stop is silent about (see
// audit-layers.ts). This gate turns that silence into a disclosed cap: when a
// maintainer has declared a diff a modeled system (the repository-context
// `domains` sentinel), it reads the reverse-audit auditors' returns, and for
// every layer none of them RECEIPTED (`Layer walked: <id>`), it emits one
// `unreviewedDimensions` entry. compose-review already caps a would-be Approve
// to Comment on any such entry and renders it in the "Not reviewed" section, so
// this reuses the existing cap — model out of the loop, like scriptLintGate.
//
// Coverage is CORROBORATED, not taken from prose alone. A receipt is text an
// auditor writes, and the reverse-audit brief hands every auditor the receipt
// form and all six layer ids — so a return that read its brief and nothing else
// holds the material to parrot all six receipts without walking a single layer.
// Counting those would release Approve on a diff whose layers went unwalked, the
// exact incident this feature exists to catch. So a transcript's receipts count
// only when it is (a) genuinely a reverse-audit auditor — matched on its launch
// IDENTITY line, not a free-text mention of the role — and (b) shown by the
// harness's tool-call record to have READ ITS TERRITORY: it made a diff read
// (`diffToolCalls > 0`) AND, when its launch prompt baked specific diff ranges,
// one of those reads overlapped them (`openedTheTerritory`, retirement's full
// bar — `diffToolCalls > 0` alone is range-blind, and an auditor that read a far
// chunk then parroted its receipts would otherwise pass). A whole-diff auditor
// bakes no ranges, so the overlap check passes and the diff-read floor stands.
//
// Two properties make it safe to land:
//
//  - **Opt-in, inert by default.** Without the `modeled-executable-system`
//    domain (which only a `.qwen/review-context.json` matching rule, read from
//    the trusted base branch, can set) the gate returns nothing. Every ordinary
//    review is untouched.
//  - **Only ever WITHHOLDS an Approve.** It appends to `unreviewedDimensions`,
//    which caps — it never ends the reverse-audit loop, never blocks a Request
//    changes, never touches the convergence rule. The corroboration errs the
//    same way: an auditor that walked a layer but whose territory read we cannot
//    see is dropped, which can only OVER-owe a layer (withhold), never release
//    one.
//
// Fail-open only where it cannot MEASURE: an unreadable plan, an invalid context,
// or a transcript read that throws yields no cap (a gate that cannot read must
// not cap a verdict on a coverage it could not measure). But a read that
// SUCCEEDS and finds reverse auditors that ran yet none corroborated is a
// measurement, not a blind spot — and the reverse-audit-ran floor does not cover
// it (compose-review's `deliveryOf` requires a verbatim launch, an opened brief
// and a read findings file, with no diff-read requirement), so this owes every
// layer rather than deferring. Only "no reverse auditor ran at all" defers to the
// floor.
