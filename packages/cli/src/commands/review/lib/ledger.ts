// The cross-round findings ledger, carried IN the posted review body.
//
// The round ledger began as a local cache file, and its first live use exposed
// the flaw: the cache lives in one clone's `.qwen/review-cache/`, so a re-review
// from CI, another machine, or a fresh checkout opens with amnesia — while the
// one artifact every environment can see, the posted review itself, carried
// nothing machine-readable. This module moves the authoritative copy into the
// review body as an HTML comment: invisible on the PR page, durable as the
// comment itself, and readable by the next round's `pr-context` wherever it
// runs. The local cache remains a fallback for runs that never posted.
//
// The marker is DATA the next round rules on, not authority it obeys: every
// ledger entry is re-asserted against the code by the Step 6 previous-round
// ruling, so a tampered marker costs the review a few wasted rulings, never a
// wrong verdict. Parsing is correspondingly fail-quiet: a body whose marker is
// malformed simply contributes no ledger.
