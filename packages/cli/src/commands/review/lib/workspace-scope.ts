// Which test suites a diff obliges a review to run — and when the answer must
// carry a caveat.
//
// `build-test` scopes its BUILD to the diff (see `workspaces.ts`), and for a
// while it tested only the workspaces the diff changed. That under-tests in
// exactly the way a compile cannot catch: a behaviour change in `core` leaves
// every dependent compiling and still fails their suites — the break surfaces
// in a consumer's tests or nowhere. So the test scope is the reverse-dependency
// closure of the diff: the changed workspaces plus everything that depends on
// them, computed from the same declared graph the build set uses.
//
// Every input that makes the scoped set possibly incomplete is DISCLOSED as a
// `caveat` on the scope — a fallback the report does not disclose is a claim
// ("these tests were run") the review cannot honestly make. Every caveat that
// applies is reported, strongest first: "nothing is silent" means composing
// the disclosures, not letting the first one hide the rest:
//
//   - A workspace whose `package.json` does not parse (or has no usable `name`)
//     is invisible to the dependency graph, so its reverse edges are missing
//     and the closure may be silently too small — the confident false green
//     this pipeline exists to prevent. The same holds for a member a glob
//     ORDERING hides from the graph (a literal entry listed before a `*` that
//     claims its parent segment): npm includes it, the walker cannot.
//   - A changed file OUTSIDE every workspace can affect any package: the test
//     scripts themselves live in the root `package.json`, and `scripts/` is
//     imported by whatever chooses to. No per-workspace subset covers that.
//     The one carve-out is the license family — a LICENSE edit cannot fail a
//     suite. Docs-classified files are NOT carved out: this repo's own root
//     AGENTS.md is read and asserted on by packages/cli's load-rules.test.ts,
//     which is exactly the load-bearing prose the carve-out would certify as
//     unable to fail anything. The root `docs/` tree IS carved out — no suite
//     here reads it, and a caveat that fires on most PRs teaches the reader to
//     ignore caveats. When the cost of erring is a sentence of
//     disclosure, not a full-suite run, err toward disclosing.
//   - A closure past HALF the testable workspaces is not a meaningful
//     narrowing, and the report should say so.
//   - A root suite that fans out over every workspace (`npm test
//     --workspaces`) cannot run as one scoped command — it would repeat the
//     whole suite inside a single deadline — so it does not run, and that is
//     disclosed the same way.
//
// None of these fall back to the repo's root test command. That command — one
// `npm test` over every workspace — is exactly what cannot finish inside a
// command deadline on a large monorepo: this repo's suite took 31 minutes in
// CI against a 300-second deadline, and measured over recent PRs a third of
// diffs would have hit the fallback. A fallback that reliably times out is not
// coverage — it is zero signal framed as a failure. The scoped set is the run
// that can finish; the caveat says what it might miss.
