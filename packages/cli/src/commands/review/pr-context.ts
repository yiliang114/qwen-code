/**
 * Does this body assert a blocking defect?
 *
 * The re-check section used to be gated on the literal `[Critical]` marker,
 * which only /review itself emits. A human blocker phrased any other way fell
 * through to "Already discussed — do NOT re-report", where it is rendered as a
 * 240-character snippet.
 *
 * On PR #6486 a maintainer built the PR, drove the real CLI, and filed
 * "🔴 Finding 1 — Ctrl+F dual-fires ... (blocker)" as an issue comment. The
 * marker never appeared. The first 240 characters were the report's preamble —
 * "I built this PR from source and drove the real CLI ... to validate the
 * model-toggle hotkey before merge" — which reads as an ENDORSEMENT, filed
 * under a heading that says not to re-report it. The blocker began 1 143
 * characters past the cut. /review reviewed that same commit three hours later
 * and submitted "no blockers"; the defect was real and was fixed that evening.
 *
 * So recognition is semantic. It matches **assertion patterns, not word
 * presence**, and that distinction was learned the hard way: the first cut of
 * this scanned the whole body for the words `blocker`, `🔴`, `阻塞` and
 * `[Critical]`, and on the live #6486 thread it promoted **8 of 15** issue
 * comments. Exactly one was a live blocker. The others:
 *
 *   - "**No** critical blockers." — the triage bot's own template line, i.e. the
 *     word appearing inside its own negation. Hence `NEGATION`.
 *   - "### 🔴 Critical **fixes**" — the author listing what he had *repaired*.
 *     A severity emoji says nothing about who is asserting what.
 *   - a later comment *quoting* `[Critical]` while arguing a finding away.
 *
 * Promotion is still deliberately fail-safe — a false positive costs one extra
 * ruling, a false negative ships the bug — but "cheap" was measured, not
 * assumed, and it was wrong: promotion means **full-body** rendering, and those
 * 8 bodies took the context file from 30 KB to 59 KB and pushed the real
 * blocker to character 43 094, past what one `read_file` returns. A blocker
 * rendered where nobody reads it is not better than one rendered as a snippet.
 * That is why the section is written FIRST and carries a size budget.
 *
 * **Tight is not the same as narrow, and the first cut of these patterns was
 * narrow.** They named the nouns — `blocking issue|defect|bug`, `阻塞项` — and a
 * second real blocker walked straight past them: a maintainer's E2E report on
 * PR #6638 (a committed extension policy that never reaches a running agent's
 * system prompt, while the API reports full convergence) is headed
 * "**86/90 checks pass, 1 blocking gap**" and "🔴 **Blocking:**", and in Chinese
 * "**阻塞问题**". Not one pattern matched. It would have settled into "Already
 * discussed" behind a 240-character snippet whose visible text is
 * _"86/90 checks pass … The store, the REST surface and the secur…"_ — an
 * endorsement, again, exactly as in #6486.
 *
 * So the patterns match the word people actually write (`blocking`, with a
 * lookbehind for `non-blocking` — our own reports file their nits under
 * "🟡 Non-blocking observations"), and the CJK forms they actually use. Measured
 * over 38 real comments from three threads: recall 1/2 → **2/2**, false
 * positives **unchanged at 6**. Widening `before merge` / `合并前` would also
 * have caught it and cost 2 and 1 more false positives respectively, so those
 * are left out. The list is calibrated against real threads, not imagined ones,
 * and it stays a **floor**: SKILL.md still scans "Already discussed" in prose.

 * and its Chinese twin "没有阻塞项", not to parse natural language. Every attempt
 * to make it more than that opened a hole in the other direction, so this
 * version is redesigned around two ideas rather than a growing lookbehind pile:
 *
 * 1. A **negation word** within ~40 chars of the signal, in either language.
 *    English negators sit on word boundaries; the CJK ones do not. `非` is a
 *    negation EXCEPT in `除非` ("unless"), which introduces a real blocking
 *    condition — hence `(?<!除)非`. `非-blocking`/`non-blocking` fold in here as
 *    the glued forms `non[- ]` / (the bare `非` clause), not as pattern
 *    lookbehinds.
 * 2. An **adversative** between the negation and the signal RESETS it: in
 *    "No concerns, but auth is a blocker" the clause after `but` is asserting,
 *    not negating. This is why a bare comma is NOT a boundary — a comma
 *    coordinates ("No blocking, must-fix, or critical issues" stays negated)
 *    while `but`/`但` reverses. The earlier comma-stop-set got this backwards
 *    and promoted coordinated negated lists.
 *
 * Prior regressions this closes, all from real review comments: `除非阻塞`
 * (unless-blocker, was suppressed), `并非一个阻塞项` (non-adjacent 非, was
 * promoted), and the coordinated list above (was promoted).

 * at all (see FOREIGN_ROUND_HEADROOM). Logins compare case-insensitively:
 * GitHub logins are, and a case mismatch would misread an own marker as
 * foreign and strip an anchor this account itself posted. A PENDING review is
 * an unsubmitted draft — the API serves the caller's own drafts in this
 * list — and a draft is not a previous round: a run that crashed between
 * creating and submitting one must not hand the next round a round number,
 * an age reference and a reviewId from state the PR never showed anyone.
 *
 * `commitId` is the winning review's own `commit_id` — the head that round
 * reviewed, set by GitHub, not by the body — the age reference for Step 6's

 *   reference and its provenance for Step 6's convergence posture. Readers
 *   of the ledger shape (compose-review's round count, Step 1's
 *   recovered-anchor check) ignore the extra keys.
 * - Not recovered, absence PROVEN (`noOwnReview` — a non-empty reviews list
 *   was walked and no submitted review by this account exists in it; an
 *   empty list may be an error envelope `ghApiAll` flattens to `[]`, and an
 *   own review whose marker fails to parse is a persistent state — neither
 *   proves absence, both strip): the PR demonstrably
 *   holds no prior round for this account — the file is another account's
 *   or a deleted round's leftovers, and it is REMOVED whole: carrying its
 *   round counter would stamp a first review "round N+1" and engage the
 *   posture on rounds this account never ran.
 * - Recovery THREW: unknowable, so the stale file keeps its round counter —
 *   a transient failure must not reset the id space — but loses
 *   `commitId`/`reviewId`: an age reference this run could not re-vouch can
 *   suppress a first-time finding on code changed-and-reverted since the
 *   true previous round (snapshot diffs are not monotonic over intervals),
 *   while dropping it merely fails open to full posting.
 * - Recovered ANONYMOUSLY (`identityKnown` false — the identity lookup threw
 *   or answered empty): with no `me`, every marker walked as FOREIGN,
 *   including this account's own, so the union that protects the certified
 *   work list never had an own side to merge over — and a wholesale write
 *   would let any drive-by marker posted at this round REPLACE this
 *   machine's last known-good list, permanently: the attacker's marker
 *   stays on the PR, so every later outage reopens the swap. When a
 *   readable file exists, an anonymous recovery therefore advances only the
 *   ROUND COUNTER (strictly higher rounds — a stale counter re-issues ids
 *   the PR already carries) and adopts the winner's `reviewId` for future
 *   tiebreaks; the findings stay this machine's own, and `sha`/`commitId`
 *   are dropped — an anonymous round cannot be re-vouched, and an anchor
 *   now superseded by rounds this account never certified must not scope
 *   the next review (the healthy foreign-winner path strips it at the
 *   recovery seam for the same reason). A same-round anonymous winner
 *   changes nothing. With no readable file there is nothing to protect,
 *   and the anonymous recovery is written whole, exactly as before.
 *
 * Every write is write-temp-then-rename: a failure mid-write must leave the
 * previous file intact, never a truncated one that parses as no round and
 * restarts the id space. Best-effort throughout — a side-file hiccup must
 * never fail the command.
