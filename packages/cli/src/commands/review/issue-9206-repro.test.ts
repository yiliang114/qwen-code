// Reproduction for issue #9206 — FAILING on the unfixed tree.
//
// /review: chunk retirement silently does not fire in the reverse-audit loop,
// and cleanup destroys the evidence.
//
// A real round-5 reverse audit (PR #9118, 12 chunks) returned substantive dry
// receipts for four chunks in BOTH rounds 1 and 2; rounds 3, 4 and 5 still
// built auditors for all 12 chunks, no `retirement:` note ever appeared, and
// no diagnostic said which certification condition rejected the receipts. Step 9
// cleanup then deleted the prompt-record directory of the non-converged run,
// making the failure undiagnosable after the fact.
//
// This file pins the two expectations the issue states:
//
//   1. A chunk whose two most recent audits returned substantive dry receipts
//      either RETIRES from round 3 on, or the builder emits a diagnostic naming
//      the certification condition that failed. Silently re-auditing a
//      twice-dry chunk with no word anywhere is the bug. Two receipt shapes a
//      human reader calls "substantive dry" stand in for the destroyed real
//      ones: an English receipt whose separator is a period, and a Chinese
//      receipt whose separator is a full-width comma. Both name what the
//      auditor re-examined; both reproduce the reported symptom end to end on
//      the installed CLI (rounds 3-5 build every chunk, zero notes, zero
//      diagnostics).
//   2. Step 9 cleanup of a NON-CONVERGED run (the loop hit its round cap)
//      must leave the prompt-record directory recoverable, because it is the
//      only place the certification history lives.
