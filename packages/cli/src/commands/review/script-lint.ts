// `qwen review script-lint`: run the deterministic linters over the executable
// code a diff adds or changes, and report what they say.
//
// A diff's shell — a `.sh`/`.bash` file, a Dockerfile `RUN`, a GitHub Actions
// `run:` block — is code, and its bugs (an unquoted `$x` that
// word-splits, a `${PIPESTATUS[1]}` read after the array was already reset, a
// `[ ]` where `[[ ]]` was meant) are exactly the class a reviewer misses by
// *reading* a 3000-line YAML and catches by *running* the checker. Measured:
// a model told in prose to "run the workflow scripts" does not — it reads and
// reasons instead (0 of 4 runs executed anything). So the execution is a
// command, not a request: `shellcheck`/`actionlint`/`hadolint` do the work, an
// agent reads this report, and coverage requires the agent ran.
//
// It is not GitHub-specific. `shellcheck` is the workhorse and applies to shell
// wherever it appears; `actionlint` and `hadolint` are format front-ends for the
// two embeds worth special-casing. A linter that is not installed is disclosed
// as skipped, never treated as a clean bill of health.

 * - One WE CONTROL, because `--config` is a file hadolint READS — a predictable
 *   fallback we do not own lets an attacker plant an `ignored:` config there and
 *   reopen the very suppression this closes. So there is NO fixed fallback: if
