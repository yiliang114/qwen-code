 * Event-bus for the daemon's per-session NDJSON stream.
 *
 * Design notes (from the threat-model):
 *   - Each event carries a monotonic `id` (per session) so the SSE
 *     `Last-Event-ID` reconnect protocol can pick up where the client left
 *     off. Backed by a bounded ring of recent events for replay.
 *   - Subscribers use bounded async queues. A slow subscriber that blows
 *     past its queue limit is sent a final `client_evicted` event and
 *     closed; this keeps a stuck client from holding the daemon hostage
 *     (per the resource-exhaustion entry in the threat-model summary).
 *   - The bus is push-based; consumers iterate the returned AsyncIterable.
 *     Aborting the supplied AbortSignal closes the iterator promptly.
