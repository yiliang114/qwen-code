## Migration Notes

- `tool_output_truncated` was renamed to `qwen-code.tool_output_truncated` for namespace consistency — downstream consumers filtering on the old name should update their queries.

- The `tool.call.latency` histogram documentation previously listed a `decision` attribute — this was never set on the histogram (only `function_name` is recorded). The `tool.call.count` counter continues to include `decision`.

- The `qwen-code.file_operation` log event and `file.operation.count` metric documentation previously listed diff-stat attributes (`model_added_lines`, `model_removed_lines`, `user_added_lines`, `user_removed_lines`) — these were never set on either. Diff-stat data is available via the `tool_call` log event's `metadata` attribute.

## Configuration

All telemetry behavior is controlled through your `.qwen/settings.json` file.
These settings can be overridden by environment variables or CLI flags.

**Note on boolean environment variables:** For the boolean settings (`enabled`,
`logPrompts`, `includeSensitiveSpanAttributes`), setting the
corresponding environment variable to `true` or `1` will enable the feature. Any
other value will disable it.

**Note on integer environment variables:** `QWEN_TELEMETRY_SENSITIVE_SPAN_ATTRIBUTE_MAX_LENGTH`
must be a positive integer when set. Invalid values fail telemetry configuration
resolution instead of silently falling back.

`gen_ai.tool.description` is non-sensitive static registry metadata and is
emitted independently of `includeSensitiveSpanAttributes`. This includes
descriptions supplied by MCP servers and other workspace tool providers. The
value is limited to 4096 UTF-16 code units and never includes dynamic invocation
details.

**Sensitive span attributes:** When `includeSensitiveSpanAttributes` is enabled,
two things happen:

1. **Native span attributes** carry standard OpenTelemetry GenAI JSON:
   - Main-agent and LLM input messages (`gen_ai.input.messages`)
   - System instructions (`gen_ai.system_instructions`)
   - Tool definitions (`gen_ai.tool.definitions`)
   - Main-agent and LLM output messages (`gen_ai.output.messages`)
   - Final executed tool arguments (`gen_ai.tool.call.arguments`)
   - Successful tool results (`gen_ai.tool.call.result`)
   - Interaction spans retain the compatibility `new_context` attribute.

   Main-agent input is one original user-text projection before context
   expansion, and main-agent output is one final user-visible answer after all
   tool and continuation work settles. LLM values still come from provider-final
   SDK request objects and raw provider responses, so their input can include
   history, expanded files, system instructions, and tool results, and their
   output can include every provider candidate. Tool values come from the final
   invocation parameters and successful model-facing result. Each
   standard GenAI value is compact JSON and must be complete and schema-valid.
   A value that is invalid, cyclic, or longer than
   `sensitiveSpanAttributeMaxLength` is omitted as a whole; JSON is never
   truncated and no preview, hash, or truncation metadata is emitted. The
   interaction-specific `new_context` attribute retains its existing
   truncation behavior. The default maximum is 1 MiB (`1048576`) per attribute
   and the accepted range is `1..104857600` (100 MiB). The limit is measured as
   JavaScript string length rather than UTF-8 bytes. Non-ASCII content can
   therefore occupy more bytes after OTLP export.

2. **Log-to-span bridge spans** (used when HTTP traces are exported without a
   logs endpoint) keep their existing `prompt`, `function_args`, and
   `response_text` fields, instead of being dropped.

⚠️ **Security warning:** enabling this flag streams full conversation history,
file contents read by `read_file`, shell commands and their output (including
secrets in env vars or arguments), and model responses to the configured OTLP
backend. Treat the backend as a privileged data sink. The flag defaults to
`false`.

**Cost / payload size:** At the default limit, one LLM span can carry at most about 4 MiB across input, output, system instructions, and tool definitions; one Tool span can carry about 2 MiB across arguments and result; and one interaction can carry about 3 MiB across Agent input, Agent output, and compatibility `new_context`. This is Qwen Code's application-side cap, not a guarantee that every collector or backend accepts a single attribute that large. If spans are rejected or dropped, lower `sensitiveSpanAttributeMaxLength` (for example, to `61440`) and monitor exporter throughput.

This setting does not disable sensitive data in OTel logs or other telemetry
sinks; non-internal API response telemetry can populate `response_text`, so
OTel logs, UI telemetry, and chat recording may receive response text
independently of this setting. QwenLogger does not include `response_text`.

**HTTP OTLP signal routing:** When using HTTP protocol (`otlpProtocol: "http"`),
Qwen Code automatically appends signal-specific paths (`/v1/traces`, `/v1/logs`,
`/v1/metrics`) to the base `otlpEndpoint`. For example, `http://collector:4318`
becomes `http://collector:4318/v1/traces` for traces. If the URL already ends
with a signal path, it is used as-is. Per-signal endpoint overrides
(`otlpTracesEndpoint`, etc.) take precedence over the base endpoint and are used
verbatim. gRPC protocol uses service-based routing and does not append paths.

The per-signal endpoint environment variables also accept the standard
OpenTelemetry names: `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT`,
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT`.
The `QWEN_TELEMETRY_OTLP_*` variants take precedence over the `OTEL_*` variants.

**End-user identity:** `telemetry.userId` and
`QWEN_TELEMETRY_USER_ID` are explicit opt-ins for the ARMS span attribute
`gen_ai.user.id`. The environment variable takes precedence after both values
are trimmed; a blank environment value falls back to settings. The identifier
is written only to interaction, LLM, Tool, and Agent spans. It is not a Resource
attribute, log or metric attribute, outbound Baggage value, or current
OpenTelemetry GenAI standard field. Prefer a stable pseudonymous identifier.
The value is resolved at startup, so configuration changes require a restart.
Do not configure a process-wide value on a daemon or channel instance serving
multiple end users.

For detailed information about all configuration options, see the
[Configuration Guide](../../users/configuration/settings.md).

### Resource attributes

Resource attributes are static key-value pairs attached to every span, log,
and metric exported via OTLP. Use them to slice telemetry by team, environment,
deployment region, or any other dimension your backend cares about.

Two sources, merged in priority order (lowest → highest):

1. The standard `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` env var
2. `telemetry.resourceAttributes` in `.qwen/settings.json` (overrides env on
   key conflict)

`OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` is a separate escape hatch — when set, it overrides
`service.name` from any other source (per the OpenTelemetry spec).

#### Examples

**Slice all telemetry by team / environment:**

```bash
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="team=platform,env=prod,cost_center=eng-123"
```

**Route to a per-tenant collector via `service.name`:**

```bash
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=qwen-code-ci
```

**Fleet baseline (`~/.qwen/settings.json`) + per-host override:**

```json
{
  "telemetry": {
    "resourceAttributes": {
      "deployment.environment": "production",
      "service.namespace": "engineering-tooling"
    }
  }
}
```

```bash
# Add a one-off tag without touching settings:
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="debug_run=true"
```

#### Reserved keys

Some keys are runtime-controlled and cannot be overridden:

- `service.version` — always set to the running CLI version. Setting it from
  any source is silently dropped with a warning.
- `session.id` — runtime-injected per session. User-provided values from
  either env or settings are dropped with a warning. The reason is that
  Resource attributes auto-attach to every metric data point; allowing user
  override would bypass [Cardinality controls](#cardinality-controls) below.
  Spans and logs always carry `session.id`.

`service.name` is **not** reserved; it follows the precedence chain above.

#### Format

`OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` follows the OpenTelemetry spec:
`key1=value1,key2=value2` with values percent-encoded. Spaces in values must
be encoded as `%20`, **commas as `%2C`** (unencoded commas split the value at
the wrong boundary and the second half is dropped as malformed). Malformed
pairs are skipped with a warning rather than failing telemetry startup.

#### Troubleshooting: when a user-provided attribute appears not to take effect

Reserved keys (`service.version`, `session.id`), malformed pairs, non-string
settings values, and invalid percent-encoding are all silently dropped with a
warning logged via the OpenTelemetry diagnostics channel. That channel routes
to the debug log file (`~/.qwen/log/otel-*.log`), **not** the console, so the
behavior can look like silent failure.

If a custom resource attribute isn't appearing on exported telemetry:

1. Check `~/.qwen/log/otel-*.log` for lines matching `cannot override` (reserved
   key dropped), `Skipping malformed` (bad env var pair), or `must be a string`
   (non-string settings value).
2. Verify the env var is set in the qwen-code process's environment (not just
   your shell) and that values are percent-encoded.
3. Confirm `telemetry.enabled` is `true` — telemetry init only runs if enabled.

### Cardinality controls

Metrics are aggregated by attribute set at the backend — every distinct
combination of attribute values produces a new time series. Attaching a
high-cardinality field like `session.id` to a metric causes time-series fan-out
proportional to the number of sessions, which quickly exhausts metric backend
storage.

To prevent this, Qwen Code keeps high-cardinality attributes off metric data
points by default. Spans and logs are per-event and unaffected, so they
continue to carry `session.id` for trace and log correlation.

#### `telemetry.metrics.includeSessionId` (default: `false`)

Setting this to `true` (via settings or
`QWEN_TELEMETRY_METRICS_INCLUDE_SESSION_ID=true`) re-attaches `session.id` to
every metric data point.

⚠️ **Warning:** each CLI session creates a new value. Leaving this on for a
fleet will blow up metric storage. Recommended only for short-term debugging.
For long-term session correlation, query trace or log backends instead.

#### Migration from earlier versions

Prior to this release, `session.id` was attached to metrics by default. If
your Prometheus queries / Grafana dashboards / alert rules reference
`session_id` on a metric, you have two options:

**Option A** — restore the previous behavior for short-term debugging:

```bash
export QWEN_TELEMETRY_METRICS_INCLUDE_SESSION_ID=true
```

or:

```json
{
  "telemetry": {
    "metrics": { "includeSessionId": true }
  }
}
```

**Option B (recommended)** — move session-level analysis off metrics. Spans
and logs still carry `session.id`, and trace / log backends (Jaeger, Tempo,
Loki, Aliyun SLS / ARMS Tracing) handle per-session slicing natively without
cardinality pressure.

### Client-side HTTP span on outbound fetch

When telemetry is enabled, Qwen Code registers `UndiciInstrumentation`
which creates a client-side HTTP span for every outbound `fetch()`
request originated by the process — including the LLM SDKs (`openai`,
`@google/genai`, `@anthropic-ai/sdk`), the MCP StreamableHTTP client, the
`WebFetch` tool, and any IDE-extension out-of-process calls. The span
lets you see network latency (TTFB / response body transfer) separately
from upstream model processing time, which the existing
`api.generateContent` span alone can't distinguish.

These spans go to your **own** OTLP collector (or file outfile) just like
the rest of the telemetry — they do not affect what is written onto the
outbound HTTP request itself. Whether the W3C `traceparent` header is
also written into the outgoing request stream is controlled by a
**separate, security-relevant setting** documented in
[outbound correlation](#outbound-correlation-security-relevant) below.

**Feedback-loop avoidance.** OTel SDK uses `fetch` internally to upload OTLP
data. Without protection, instrumenting `fetch` would trace those uploads,
which would themselves be uploaded, causing an infinite loop. Qwen Code's
undici instrumentation is configured with an `ignoreRequestHook` that skips
URLs matching the configured `telemetry.otlpEndpoint` /
`telemetry.otlpTracesEndpoint` / `telemetry.otlpLogsEndpoint` /
`telemetry.otlpMetricsEndpoint` prefixes. In file-outfile mode there are no
outbound HTTP uploads, so the hook is a no-op.

## Outbound correlation (SECURITY-RELEVANT)

These settings live in a **separate top-level namespace** from `telemetry.*`
on purpose: telemetry controls data flow into the operator's own
observability backend, while `outboundCorrelation.*` controls what
client-side correlation data qwen-code writes **into outbound LLM API
request streams** that reach third-party LLM provider endpoints
(DashScope, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.). Different recipients, different
consent decision. **All values default to off.** See PR #4390 review
discussion for the framing rationale.

### `outboundCorrelation.propagateTraceContext`

```jsonc
"outboundCorrelation": {
  "propagateTraceContext": false // default
}
```

When `false` (default), Qwen Code installs a no-op `TextMapPropagator` on
the OTel SDK. UndiciInstrumentation still creates client HTTP spans for
your OTLP collector, but `propagation.inject()` is a no-op so **no
`traceparent` is written onto outbound requests**. Trace IDs stay
internal to the operator's collector.

When `true`, the SDK's default W3C composite propagator
(`tracecontext` + `baggage`) is installed and the standard `traceparent`
header is written on every outbound `fetch`:

```
traceparent: 00-<32-hex traceId>-<16-hex parentSpanId>-<01-sampled | 00-not-sampled>
```

Additionally, `TRACEPARENT` and `TRACESTATE` environment variables are set in
shell child processes (Bash tool, hooks, monitor) so that spawned commands can
participate in the same distributed trace.

Opt in only when the LLM provider also reports into your OTel collector
for cross-process trace stitching — e.g. ARMS Tracing serving DashScope.
For most operators the value is `false`; cross-vendor trace continuation
is niche.

**Depends on `telemetry.enabled: true`.** The OTel SDK only initializes
when telemetry is enabled, so `propagateTraceContext` only takes effect
in that state. Setting it to `true` while telemetry is disabled is a
silent no-op — no SDK, no propagator, no `traceparent` on the wire.
Verify both flags when wiring an ARMS+DashScope correlation setup:

```jsonc
{
  "telemetry": {
    "enabled": true,
    "otlpTracesEndpoint": "http://tracing-analysis-...",
  },
  "outboundCorrelation": {
    "propagateTraceContext": true,
  },
}
```

### Other outbound correlation headers

`X-Qwen-Code-Session-Id` and `X-Qwen-Code-Request-Id` are **not part of
this PR**. They will be designed and proposed in their own follow-up
PR(s) under the same `outboundCorrelation.*` namespace, each with its
own threat model and operator-consent flow. PR #4390 review (LaZzyMan)
established the principle: "telemetry's scope of work doesn't include
sending identifiers to LLM providers"; correlation-header work moves to
its own design discussion rather than landing under telemetry.

## Aliyun Telemetry

### Manual OTLP Export

To view Qwen Code telemetry in Alibaba Cloud Managed Service for
OpenTelemetry, configure Qwen Code to export to the OTLP endpoint
provided by ARMS.

Setting `"target": "gcp"` alone does not configure the export
destination. If `otlpEndpoint` is not set, Qwen Code still defaults to
`http://localhost:4317`. If `outfile` is set, it overrides
`otlpEndpoint` and telemetry is written to the file instead of being
sent to Alibaba Cloud.

1. Enable telemetry in your `.qwen/settings.json` and set the OTLP
   endpoint:

   **Option A: gRPC protocol** (standard OTLP endpoint):

   ```json
   {
     "telemetry": {
       "enabled": true,
       "target": "gcp",
       "otlpEndpoint": "https://<your-otlp-endpoint>",
       "otlpProtocol": "grpc"
     }
   }
   ```

   **Option B: HTTP protocol with per-signal endpoints** (for backends
   that use non-standard paths, e.g., `/api/otlp/traces` instead of
   `/v1/traces`):

   ```json
   {
     "telemetry": {
       "enabled": true,
       "otlpProtocol": "http",
       "otlpTracesEndpoint": "http://<host>/<token>/api/otlp/traces",
       "otlpLogsEndpoint": "http://<host>/<token>/api/otlp/logs",
       "otlpMetricsEndpoint": "http://<host>/<token>/api/otlp/metrics"
     }
   }
   ```

   > **Note:** When using HTTP protocol with only `otlpEndpoint` (no
   > per-signal overrides), Qwen Code appends standard OTLP paths
   > (`/v1/traces`, `/v1/logs`, `/v1/metrics`) to the base URL. If your
   > backend uses different paths, use per-signal endpoint overrides as
   > shown in Option B.

   To populate ARMS Session Analysis `User ID`, add a stable pseudonymous
   identity as a span-level setting:

   ```json
   {
     "telemetry": {
       "userId": "user-079458",
       "resourceAttributes": {
         "acs.arms.service.feature": "genai_app"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   For container deployments, set
   `QWEN_TELEMETRY_USER_ID=user-079458` instead. A custom
   `telemetry.resourceAttributes.user.id` remains an unrelated Resource
   dimension and does not populate ARMS Session Analysis; remove it when
   migrating to the span-level setting.

2. If your Alibaba Cloud endpoint requires authentication, provide OTLP
   headers through standard OpenTelemetry environment variables such as
   `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` (or the signal-specific variants). Qwen
   Code does not currently expose OTLP auth headers directly in
   `.qwen/settings.json`.
3. Run Qwen Code and send prompts.
4. View telemetry in Managed Service for OpenTelemetry:
   - Product overview:
     [What is Managed Service for OpenTelemetry?][aliyun-opentelemetry-overview]
   - Getting started:
     [Get started with Managed Service for OpenTelemetry][aliyun-opentelemetry-get-started]
   - Console entry points:
     - China mainland:
       [trace.console.aliyun.com][aliyun-opentelemetry-console-cn]
       (legacy console:
       [tracing.console.aliyun.com][aliyun-opentelemetry-console-cn-legacy])
     - International:
       [arms.console.alibabacloud.com][aliyun-opentelemetry-console-intl]
   - In the console, use `Applications` to inspect traces and service
     topology.
   - To locate the OTLP endpoint and access information:
     - **New console** (`trace.console.aliyun.com` or international):
       navigate to `Integration Center`.
     - **Legacy console** (`tracing.console.aliyun.com`): navigate to
       `Cluster Configurations` → `Access point information`.

## Local Telemetry

For local development and debugging, you can capture telemetry data locally:

### File-based Output (Recommended)

1. Enable telemetry in your `.qwen/settings.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "telemetry": {
       "enabled": true,
       "outfile": ".qwen/telemetry.log"
     }
   }
   ```

   > **Note:** When `outfile` is set, OTLP export is automatically disabled.
   > The `target` and `otlpEndpoint` settings are not needed for file-only
   > output and can be safely omitted from your config.

2. Run Qwen Code and send prompts.
3. View logs and metrics in the specified file (e.g., `.qwen/telemetry.log`).

### Collector-Based Export (Advanced)

1. Run the automation script:
   ```bash
   npm run telemetry -- --target=local
   ```
   This will:
   - Download and start Jaeger and OTEL collector
   - Configure your workspace for local telemetry
   - Provide a Jaeger UI at http://localhost:16686
   - Save logs/metrics to `~/.qwen/tmp/<projectHash>/otel/collector.log`
   - Stop collector on exit (e.g. `Ctrl+C`)
2. Run Qwen Code and send prompts.
3. View traces at http://localhost:16686 and logs/metrics in the collector log
   file.

## Logs and Metrics

The following section describes the structure of logs, metrics, and spans
generated for Qwen Code.

- A `sessionId` is included as a common attribute on all logs and metrics.

### Logs

Logs are timestamped records of specific events. All log records automatically include `event.name` and `event.timestamp` attributes.

The following events are logged:

#### Core Session Events

- `qwen-code.config`: Emitted once at startup with CLI configuration.
  - **Attributes**: `model`, `sandbox_enabled`, `core_tools_enabled`, `approval_mode`, `file_filtering_respect_git_ignore`, `debug_mode`, `truncate_tool_output_threshold`, `truncate_tool_output_lines`, `hooks` (comma-separated, omitted if disabled), `ide_enabled`, `interactive_shell_enabled`, `mcp_servers`, `mcp_servers_count`, `mcp_tools`, `mcp_tools_count`, `output_format`, `skills`, `subagents`

- `session.start`: A session begins. Emitted after telemetry initialization at startup and again on every session switch; lifecycle semantics are described in the Spans section.
  - **Attributes**: `session.id` (string), `session.previous_id` (string, present only when this start continues a persisted conversation under a new session id)

- `session.end`: A session ends. Emitted before a session switch replaces the current session, and at telemetry shutdown.
  - **Attributes**: `session.id` (string)

- `qwen-code.user_prompt`: User submits a prompt.
  - **Attributes**: `prompt_length` (int), `prompt_id` (string), `prompt` (string, excluded if `log_prompts_enabled` is false), `auth_type` (string)

- `qwen-code.user_retry`: User retries the last prompt.
  - **Attributes**: `prompt_id` (string)

- `qwen-code.conversation_finished`: A conversation turn sequence completes.

#### Tool Events

- `qwen-code.tool_call`: Each function/tool call. Terminal events are normalized so `status` is authoritative: success and cancelled events omit error fields, while error events always have a non-empty `error_type` (`unknown` when the producer did not classify the error). Blank tool names are emitted as `unknown_tool`. A missing `execution_status` is normalized to `unknown` and is never inferred from the terminal `status`.
  - **Attributes**: `function_name` (string), `function_args` (object), `call_id` (string, optional), `duration_ms` (int), `status` (string: "success", "error", or "cancelled"), `execution_status` (string: "not_started", "success", "error", "cancelled", or "unknown"), `success` (boolean), `decision` (string: "accept", "reject", "auto_accept", or "modify", optional), `error` (string, optional), `error_type` (string, present for error events), `prompt_id` (string), `response_id` (string, optional), `content_length` (int, optional), `tool_type` (string: "native" or "mcp"), `mcp_server_name` (string, optional), `metadata` (object, optional — for file-writing tools contains `model_added_lines`, `model_removed_lines`, `user_added_lines`, `user_removed_lines`, `model_added_chars`, `model_removed_chars`, `user_added_chars`, `user_removed_chars`)

### Spans

Distributed tracing spans form a tree rooted at `qwen-code.interaction`. In the CLI, each interaction is a trace root with its own `traceId`; ACP and daemon paths may inherit an inbound parent context. Cross-prompt correlation uses the `session.id` attribute.

Session lifecycle is also exported through the OpenTelemetry General Session
semantic conventions. When the OTel logs pipeline is enabled, Qwen Code emits
`session.start` and `session.end` log events with the required `session.id`
attribute (cataloged under Core Session Events above). A resumed persisted
conversation includes `session.previous_id` on its `session.start` event only
when the resumed session id differs from the current one; cold-start
resumptions (`--resume`, `--continue`, `--fork-session`) do not carry it.
`/clear` and other replacement flows intentionally do not claim continuation
because they discard the previous conversation.

The existing Qwen-specific `qwen-code.config`/`cli_config` and RUM
`session_start` records remain available for compatibility. GenAI request
spans continue to use `gen_ai.conversation.id` for the same owning session ID.

- `qwen-code.interaction`: Main-agent invocation span. It covers all LLM requests, tool approval/execution, and continuations for one logical prompt. User queries, retries, cron prompts, notifications, teammate messages, and Goal turns create invocations; tool results, hooks, and steering reuse the exact active prompt ID.
  - **GenAI attributes**: `gen_ai.operation.name` (`invoke_agent`), `gen_ai.agent.name` (`qwen-code`), `gen_ai.conversation.id`, optional `gen_ai.output.type` (`json` only with a configured JSON Schema), sensitive `gen_ai.input.messages`, sensitive `gen_ai.output.messages`, and optional ARMS extension `gen_ai.user.id`
  - **Compatibility attributes**: `session.id`, `qwen-code.prompt_id`, `qwen-code.message_type`, `qwen-code.model`, `qwen-code.approval_mode`, `interaction.sequence`, `interaction.duration_ms`, `qwen-code.turn_status` ("ok"/"error"/"cancelled")
  - `gen_ai.request.model` is intentionally omitted because the agent supports overrides, fallback, and dynamic model selection. `gen_ai.provider.name` and agent ID/version/description are also omitted.
  - Agent input is one original user prompt, not the expanded model request. Agent output is one final user-visible text projection; structured JSON uses compact JSON text with `finish_reason=tool_call`. Both are omitted unless sensitive span attributes are enabled and the complete JSON fits the per-attribute limit.

- `qwen-code.llm_request`: Wraps a single LLM API call.
  - **GenAI attributes**: `gen_ai.operation.name`, `gen_ai.provider.name`, `gen_ai.conversation.id`, optional ARMS extension `gen_ai.user.id`, `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.request.stream`, `gen_ai.request.choice.count`, `gen_ai.request.max_tokens`, `gen_ai.request.temperature`, `gen_ai.request.top_p`, `gen_ai.request.frequency_penalty`, `gen_ai.request.presence_penalty`, `gen_ai.request.stop_sequences`, optional `gen_ai.output.type`, `gen_ai.response.id`, `gen_ai.response.model`, `gen_ai.response.finish_reasons`, `gen_ai.response.time_to_first_chunk`, `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens`, `gen_ai.usage.output_tokens`, `gen_ai.usage.cache_read.input_tokens`, `gen_ai.usage.cache_creation.input_tokens`
  - **Compatibility attributes**: `session.id`, `qwen-code.prompt_id`, `llm_request.context` ("subagent"/"interaction"/"standalone"), `duration_ms`, `ttft_ms`, `request_setup_ms`, `attempt`, `retry_total_delay_ms`, `sampling_ms`, `output_tokens_per_second`, `success`, `error`, `finish_reason`, `thoughts_token_count`, `subagent_name`, `error_type`, `error_status_code`
  - Standard response fields come from the provider response. Standard token fields are emitted only for provider-reported non-negative safe integers. If the provider reports only a total token count, input/output usage is omitted rather than estimated.
  - Standard request-parameter fields come from the first provider-final SDK request object after adapter defaults, overrides, unsupported-field removal, and output-window clamps. Qwen Code does not infer SDK or server defaults.
  - Streaming requests emit `gen_ai.request.stream=true`. `gen_ai.response.time_to_first_chunk` measures seconds from the provider call to the first normalized response yielded by the provider adapter, which may differ from the first raw network frame. Non-streaming requests omit both standard streaming attributes because an absent `gen_ai.request.stream` means non-streaming in the semantic convention.

- `qwen-code.tool`: Wraps the full tool lifecycle (approval wait + execution).
  - **Attributes**: `session.id`, optional ARMS extension `gen_ai.user.id`, `gen_ai.operation.name` (`execute_tool`), optional inherited `gen_ai.agent.name`, `gen_ai.tool.name`, `gen_ai.tool.type` (`function`), `gen_ai.tool.call.id`, `tool.call_id`, `duration_ms`, `success`, `error`, `error.type` on failure, `tool.failure_kind` (string, optional — the specific failure reason, e.g. "cancelled", "tool_error", "tool_exception", "timeout", "permission_denied", "pre_hook_blocked")

- `qwen-code.tool.execution`: Wraps the tool execution phase (after approval). Emitted only for attempted executions.
  - **Attributes**: `session.id`, `gen_ai.tool.name` (optional), `tool.call_id` (optional), `duration_ms`, `success`, `error`, `execution_status` ("success"/"error"/"cancelled"), `error_type`, `error.type`

- `qwen-code.tool.blocked_on_user`: Time a tool spends waiting on user approval.
  - **Attributes**: `session.id`, `tool.name`, `tool.call_id`, `duration_ms`, `decision` ("proceed_once"/"proceed_always"/"cancel"/"aborted"/"auto_approved"/"error"), `source` ("cli"/"ide"/"hook"/"auto"/"system")

- `qwen-code.hook`: Wraps each pre/post-tool-use hook fire site.
  - **Attributes**: `session.id`, `hook_event` ("PreToolUse"/"PostToolUse"/"PostToolUseFailure"/"PostToolBatch"), `tool.name`, `tool.use_id` (optional), `is_interrupt` (boolean, optional), `duration_ms`, `success`, `should_proceed` (optional), `should_stop` (optional), `block_type` (optional), `error` (optional)

- `qwen-code.subagent`: Wraps a single subagent invocation.
  - **Attributes**: `gen_ai.operation.name` (`invoke_agent`), `gen_ai.agent.name`, `gen_ai.agent.description`, `gen_ai.conversation.id`, optional ARMS extension `gen_ai.user.id`, optional `gen_ai.request.model`, `qwen-code.subagent.id`, `qwen-code.subagent.name`, `qwen-code.subagent.invocation_kind` ("foreground"/"fork"/"background"), `qwen-code.subagent.is_built_in`, `qwen-code.subagent.depth`, `qwen-code.subagent.status`, `qwen-code.subagent.terminate_reason`, `qwen-code.subagent.duration_ms`

Successful and cancelled GenAI spans leave `SpanStatus` as `UNSET`. Failures set `ERROR`, a bounded status description, and low-cardinality `error.type`.

#### GenAI field migration and ARMS recognition

LLM spans now use standard `gen_ai.request.*`, `gen_ai.response.*`, and `gen_ai.usage.*` fields without exact-equivalent private aliases. Request sampling attributes are written only under their standard names; no bare `temperature`, `top_p`, `max_tokens`, penalty, choice-count, or stop-sequence aliases are emitted. Tool spans similarly use `gen_ai.tool.name` without `tool.name`; blocked-on-user and hook spans keep `tool.name` because they are not GenAI Tool spans. The invalid aliases `gen_ai.usage.cached_tokens`, `gen_ai.server.time_to_first_token`, and `gen_ai.usage.reasoning_tokens` are no longer emitted. Use `gen_ai.usage.cache_read.input_tokens` for provider-reported cache reads and `gen_ai.response.time_to_first_chunk` for standard streaming latency. The private `ttft_ms` Span attribute remains available for first-user-visible-output latency and continues driving `/stats`, `sampling_ms`, and output-token throughput; `gen_ai.response.time_to_first_chunk` is an independent standard attribute measuring first normalized chunk latency. The full version-pinned contract and deferred fields are documented in [GenAI and ARMS field alignment](../../design/gen-ai-arms-field-alignment.md).

To make ARMS recognize exported spans as a GenAI application, configure its resource feature explicitly:

```json
{
  "telemetry": {
    "resourceAttributes": {
      "acs.arms.service.feature": "genai_app"
    }
  }
}
```

Qwen Code does not inject this ARMS-specific resource attribute or `gen_ai.span.kind`. ARMS can infer LLM, Tool, and Agent roles from `gen_ai.operation.name`.

  - **Attributes**: `http.request.method`, `http.route`, `qwen-code.daemon.operation`, `session.id`, `http.response.status_code`

- `qwen-code.daemon.bridge`: Wraps daemon bridge operations.
  - **Attributes**: `qwen-code.daemon.operation`

#### Resource Metrics

- `qwen-code.memory.usage` (Histogram, bytes): Memory usage. Recorded by the memory-pressure monitor when telemetry is enabled.
  - **Attributes**: `memory_type` (string: "heap_used"/"rss")

- `qwen-code.cpu.usage` (Histogram, percent): CPU usage percentage. Recorded by the memory-pressure monitor when telemetry is enabled.
