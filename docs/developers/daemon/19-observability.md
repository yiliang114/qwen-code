# Observability & Debugging

## Overview

`qwen serve` currently ships with **OpenTelemetry span instrumentation**, **structured file logs** (`DaemonLogger`), **per-request access logs**, debug stderr logs, structured preflight cells, and an in-memory permission audit ring. This page is a practical guide to the current observability surface and the gaps to remember during triage.

## What exists today

| Surface                                     | Location                                       | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## What does not exist today

- **No Prometheus / metrics endpoint.** OTel metrics can be exported, but the daemon does not expose a Prometheus scrape endpoint.
- **No external audit sink for `PermissionAuditRing`.** The ring exists, but fan-out hooks to SIEM or external storage are not wired.

## Debugging recipes

### 1. Is the daemon alive?

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4170/health
# {"status":"ok"}

curl -s 'http://127.0.0.1:4170/health?deep=1' | jq
# {"status":"ok","workspaceCount":N,"sessions":N,...}
```

Deep health totals all managed workspace runtimes, including runtimes still
draining. It is an informational counter snapshot, not per-workspace readiness;
use `/daemon/status` when individual workspace or transport diagnostics matter.

A 401 on loopback means `--require-auth` is likely enabled. Use `QWEN_SERVE_DEBUG=1` at startup to see boot logs.

### 2. Which features are advertised?

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4170/capabilities | jq
```

Check `mcp_workspace_pool` (F2 pool on?), `require_auth` (hardened?), `permission_mediation.modes` (supported policies), and `policy.permission` (active policy).

### 3. Is daemon-host readiness healthy?

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4170/workspace/preflight | jq
```

`status: 'not_started'` cells are ACP-level and populate only after the first session attaches. `status: 'fail'` cells include a closed `errorKind`; render structured remediation from [`18-error-taxonomy.md`](./18-error-taxonomy.md).

### 4. Tail a session SSE stream

```bash
curl -N -H 'Accept: text/event-stream' \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer XYZ' \
     -H 'X-Qwen-Client-Id: debug-tail' \
     -H 'Last-Event-ID: 0' \
     'http://127.0.0.1:4170/session/<sid>/events'
```

`-N` disables curl output buffering. `Last-Event-ID: 0` requests replay for ring events with `id > 0`.

### 5. Why did a permission request resolve this way?

`PermissionAuditRing` is in-memory and has no HTTP surface today. Enable `QWEN_SERVE_DEBUG=1` and reproduce; the mediator prints structured lines for each vote and decision, including `decisionReason.type`. A later PR can expose the ring through HTTP.

### 6. Which consumer is slow?

`slow_client_warning` fires once per overflow episode when the queue reaches 75%. Subscribe to the session SSE stream and look for the synthetic frame; payload includes `queueSize`, `maxQueued`, and `lastEventId`. Repeated warnings point at a stuck consumer, usually a blocked SDK `for await` loop.

### 7. Why was an MCP server refused?

Combine `/workspace/mcp` per-cell `disabledReason: 'budget'`, the `refusedServerNames` list, and `mcp_child_refused_batch` SSE events. Compare them with `/capabilities` `mcp_guardrails.modes` (`enforce` active?) and the live `--mcp-client-budget` state visible through `getReservedSlots()`.

### 8. The daemon will not shut down

The first signal triggers graceful shutdown (see [`02-serve-runtime.md`](./02-serve-runtime.md)). If it hangs past 10s, check:

- ACP child process did not respond to graceful close.
- Long SSE connections kept HTTP `server.close()` open past `SHUTDOWN_FORCE_CLOSE_MS` (5s).

A **second** SIGTERM/SIGINT intentionally triggers `bridge.killAllSync()` + `process.exit(1)`.

### 9. Is the daemon event loop, prompt queue, or ACP pipe overloaded?

`GET /daemon/status` may include `runtime.perf` when the production daemon runtime injects the perf snapshot provider:

```json
{
  "runtime": {
    "perf": {
      "eventLoop": { "meanMs": 1.2, "p50Ms": 1.0, "p99Ms": 9.5, "maxMs": 25 },
      "promptQueueWait": {
        "count": 3,
        "meanMs": 12.5,
        "maxMs": 35,
        "lastMs": 4
      },
      "pipe": {
        "inbound": { "count": 42, "totalBytes": 100000, "maxBytes": 12000 },
        "outbound": { "count": 41, "totalBytes": 90000, "maxBytes": 11000 }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The status payload is daemon-only. `promptQueueWait` summarizes prompt FIFO queue wait samples observed in the daemon process. ACP child event loop lag is intentionally not aggregated into `/daemon/status`; it is visible through OTel gauge `qwen-code.acp.event_loop.lag` and through stderr stall lines forwarded into daemon logs.

New OTel metric names:

- `qwen-code.daemon.event_loop.lag`, gauge in milliseconds with `stat=mean|p50|p99|max`.
- `qwen-code.acp.event_loop.lag`, gauge in milliseconds with `stat=mean|p50|p99|max`.
- `qwen-code.daemon.prompt.queue_wait`, histogram in milliseconds.
- `qwen-code.daemon.pipe.message_bytes`, histogram in bytes with `direction=inbound|outbound`.

## Flow

### Typical triage flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User reports issue] --> B{daemon alive?}
    B -->|no| BD[check process; check boot logs]
    B -->|yes| C{capabilities match expectations?}
    C -->|no| CD["check --require-auth, QWEN_SERVE_NO_MCP_POOL, settings.json"]
    C -->|yes| D{preflight all green?}
    D -->|no| DD["fix the errorKind cell"]
    D -->|yes| E{issue is session-specific?}
    E -->|yes| ES["tail SSE for that session;<br/>QWEN_SERVE_DEBUG=1 + reproduce"]
    E -->|no| EW["check /workspace/mcp,<br/>/workspace/env"]
```

## State and lifecycle

- `QWEN_SERVE_DEBUG` is read on every check through `isServeDebugMode()` from `debug-mode.ts`; toggling it does not require restart. Boot logs are not available unless the env was set at boot.
- `PermissionAuditRing` is bounded at 512 FIFO entries; older records are silently dropped.
- `DaemonStatusProvider` rebuilds cells per request and does not cache; avoid unnecessary high-frequency polling.

## Dependencies

- `process.stderr.write` for debug stderr.
- `DaemonLogger` for structured file logs.
- OpenTelemetry SDK through `initializeTelemetry` and `createDaemonBridgeTelemetry`.
- `node:perf_hooks.monitorEventLoopDelay` for daemon and ACP event loop lag gauges.
- `node:process` for env and signal inspection.

## Configuration

| Knob                            | Effect                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `QWEN_SERVE_DEBUG`              | Enables verbose stderr logs. See [`17-configuration.md`](./17-configuration.md).             |
| `settings.json` `telemetry`     | Controls OTel behavior: `enabled`, `otlpEndpoint`, `otlpProtocol`, and per-signal endpoints. |
| `DaemonLogger` log path         | Generated at boot and printed to stderr as `daemon log -> <path>`.                           |
| `PermissionAuditRing` size      | Hard-coded to 512 today.                                                                     |
| `slow_client_warning` threshold | `0.75` / `0.375`, hard-coded in `eventBus.ts`.                                               |

## Caveats and known limits

- **DaemonLogger file logs are structured** and can be filtered by `route`, `sessionId`, and `clientId`. `QWEN_SERVE_DEBUG` stderr logs remain unstructured text.
- **OpenTelemetry spans include per-request correlation.** Classified daemon API requests that pass bearer authentication, rate limiting, and body parsing carry canonical route, sessionId, clientId, and (when uniquely resolved) `qwen-code.workspace.hash` attributes. Requests rejected by an earlier middleware gate do not have these request spans.
- **HTTP metrics are daemon-global.** OpenTelemetry HTTP request metrics and the Web Shell status metrics ring do not include a workspace dimension. A successful session SSE connection has a request span but is excluded from ordinary request count/duration metrics because its lifetime is not request latency; failed SSE handshakes are counted normally.
- **`runtime.perf` is daemon-only.** Child event loop lag is not reported there by design; use OTel or forwarded stderr stall warnings for ACP child stalls.
- **ACP-level `/workspace/preflight` cells require a live session.** On an idle daemon, auth / MCP / skills / providers may show `status: 'not_started'`; this is expected.
- **`/workspace/env` only reports secret presence, not values.** Do not expose the response where the mere presence of a secret is sensitive.
- **The audit ring is process-local** and history is lost on daemon restart.
- **No load-test recipe is documented here.** The performance baseline lives on the `test/perf-daemon-baseline` branch.
