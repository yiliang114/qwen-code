# Auth & Security Model

## Overview

`qwen serve` is a local daemon by default and an exposed surface in the wrong configuration. Its security model is **layered** so that misconfiguration fails closed:

1. **Bind** — non-loopback bind without a bearer token **refuses to start**.
2. **Bearer auth** — `bearerAuth` middleware with constant-time SHA-256 compare protects every route except `/health` on loopback (`require_auth` extends this to loopback and `/health` too).
3. **Host header allowlist** — on loopback, only `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`, `host.docker.internal` (plus port) are accepted; defense against DNS rebinding. The Local Control LAN listener is the exception that always enforces its advertised-authority Host check, whatever the primary bind is.
4. **Origin control** — the runtime app always installs `allowOriginCors` over a mutable allowlist (`MutableOriginAllowlist`): the `--allow-origin <pattern>` entries seed it, and Local Control adds the LAN origin while enabled. Non-matching origins receive the 403 deny envelope. The unconditional deny wall (`denyBrowserOriginCors`) survives only in the bootstrap app that answers before the runtime starts.
5. **Per-route mutation gate** — Wave 4 mutating routes can opt in to `401` responses even on loopback when no token is configured, using a distinct `code: 'token_required'` error.
6. **Device-flow auth** — separate OAuth surface for providers (`POST /workspace/auth/device-flow` + GET/DELETE on `/:id`).

This doc walks through each layer and the explicit invariants the boot path enforces.

## Responsibilities

- Refuse to boot in unsafe configurations.
- Gate every HTTP request through bearer (when configured) + host (loopback) + origin checks.
- Provide a per-route mutation gate Wave 4 routes opt into.
- Host the device-flow registry that drives provider OAuth flows visible via SSE events.

## Architecture

### Boot-time refuse rules

In `run-qwen-serve.ts`:

```ts
if (!isLoopbackBind(opts.hostname) && !token) {
  throw new Error('Refusing to bind <host>:<port> without a bearer token. ...');
}
if (opts.requireAuth && !token) {
  throw new Error(
    'Refusing to start with --require-auth set but no bearer token configured. ...',
  );
}
```

The allow-origin wildcard has its own refuse rule:

```ts
const parsed = parseAllowOriginPatterns(opts.allowOrigins);
if (parsed.allowAny && !token) {
  throw new Error(
    "Refusing to start with --allow-origin '*' but no bearer token configured. ...",
  );
}
```

All three refusals are explicit boot failures (visible in stderr / thrown to the embedder),
never silent. The threat model from #3803 explicitly forbids silently letting a
daemon bind beyond loopback in the open.

### Middleware chain (HTTP request order)

    REQ[Request] --> SO["strip same-origin Origin<br/>(Web Shell support)"]
    SO --> AO["allowOriginCors<br/>(mutable allowlist: --allow-origin<br/>patterns + Local Control LAN origin)"]
    AO --> HA["hostAllowlist"]
    HA --> LOG["access-log middleware<br/>(DaemonLogger)"]
    LOG --> BA["bearerAuth"]
    BA --> RL["rate-limit middleware<br/>(when enabled)"]
    RL --> JSON["express.json<br/>(body parser)"]
    JSON --> TEL["daemonTelemetryMiddleware<br/>(OTel span)"]
    TEL --> MG["per-route: mutationGate<br/>(opt-in strict)"]
    MG --> HANDLER["route handler"]
```

`mutationGate` is a per-route middleware factory (`createMutationGate` returns
`mutate()`); routes call `mutate()` or `mutate({strict: true})` at registration
time. It is not a global `app.use()` middleware. Access logging is registered
before `bearerAuth` so 401 rejects are still logged. Rate limiting runs after
`bearerAuth` and before `express.json()`, so only authenticated requests count
and large bodies are rejected before parsing when a limit is exceeded.

### `bearerAuth`

- **No token configured** → middleware is a no-op (loopback developer default). Exception: the Local Control **LAN listener** is listener-scoped and always requires its pairing credential (`CredentialStore.isOpen` is never true for `local-control`), so it is never open even on a token-less daemon.
- **Token configured** → SHA-256 the configured token once at construction; on every request hash the candidate and `timingSafeEqual` compare. No string-equality short-circuit; no time-leak.
- **Scheme parsing**: case-insensitive `Bearer` per RFC 7235 §2.1; tolerant of `SP\tHTAB` between scheme and credentials per RFC 7230 §3.2.6 BWS; rejects pure-HTAB-as-separator.
- **CodeQL hardening**: hand-rolled `indexOf` parsing rather than regex with `\s+` / `.+` overlap (no polynomial-regex risk).

### `hostAllowlist`

Loopback-only. Maintains a `Set<string>` keyed by port. Allowed Hosts:

- `localhost:<port>`, `127.0.0.1:<port>`, `[::1]:<port>`, `host.docker.internal:<port>`.
- Plus no-port forms (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`, `host.docker.internal`) **only** when bound to port 80 (per RFC 7230 §5.4 default-port omission).

Host comparison is **case-insensitive** — Express normalizes header names but not values, so Docker proxies that capitalize Hosts (`Localhost:4170`, `HOST.docker.internal`) would 403 with an exact-string compare.

Non-loopback binds bypass the primary gate (operator chose the surface area; bearer token gates Host spoofing instead). The Local Control LAN listener is the exception: it always enforces its advertised-authority Host check, whatever the primary bind is.

### `denyBrowserOriginCors` (bootstrap app only)

Reject any request with an `Origin` header. CLI/SDK never set Origin; only browsers do. Returns deterministic `403 { error: 'Request denied by CORS policy' }` rather than the 500 HTML the `cors` package's error-callback would produce. The runtime app no longer installs this wall — it runs `allowOriginCors` over the mutable allowlist (below); the deny behavior survives there as the unmatched-origin branch. The wall remains in the bootstrap app (run-qwen-serve.ts) that serves requests before the runtime starts.

Exception: the Web Shell's same-origin XHRs on a **loopback** bind are handled by a separate middleware (in `server/self-origin.ts`) that strips `Origin` when it matches one of the loopback self-origins (`127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `[::1]`, `host.docker.internal`). On non-loopback binds the shell's XHRs carry an unmatched `Origin` and need `--allow-origin` for the daemon origin.

### `allowOriginCors` (runtime app, always installed)

The runtime app installs `allowOriginCors(originAllowlist)` unconditionally;
the allowlist is a `MutableOriginAllowlist` seeded from the `--allow-origin
<pattern>` entries (possibly none) and extended at runtime while Local
Control is enabled (the LAN origin is added/removed with the listener):

- Matching `Origin` values receive `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`,
  `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`, and `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`; `OPTIONS`
  preflight returns `204`.
- Non-matching `Origin` values receive the same deterministic
  `403 { error: 'Request denied by CORS policy' }` as deny mode.
- `--allow-origin '*'` requires `--token`; otherwise boot refuses.
- `parseAllowOriginPatterns()` validates pattern syntax at boot.
- The `allow_origin` capability tag is advertised only when this mode is
  configured.

### `createMutationGate`

Per-route opt-in gate. Behavior matrix:

| daemon config           | route opts                      | result                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `requireAuth=true`      | any                             | passthrough¹                     |
| `token` configured      | any                             | passthrough²                     |
| no token (loopback dev) | `strict: false`                 | passthrough                      |
| no token (loopback dev) | `strict: true`, unauthenticated | `401 { code: 'token_required' }` |
| no token (loopback dev) | `strict: true`, authenticated³  | passthrough                      |

¹ `--require-auth` boots only with a token, so global `bearerAuth` already 401'd unauthenticated callers.
² Any token configuration makes global `bearerAuth` enforce bearer-required-everywhere; the gate is redundant but harmless.
³ Authenticated via a listener-scoped credential: the Local Control LAN listener verifies its pairing credential even on a token-less daemon and stamps the request as authenticated, so strict routes pass for the paired LAN client.

The `code: 'token_required'` shape is distinct from `bearerAuth`'s plain `Unauthorized` so SDK clients can render a "configure --token / --require-auth" hint instead of a generic 401.

**Wave 4+ strict routes**: `/workspace/memory`, `/workspace/agents/*`,
`/workspace/agents/generate`, `/file/write`, `/file/edit`,
`/workspace/tools/:name/enable`, `/workspace/mcp/:server/restart`,
`/workspace/mcp/:server/{enable,disable,authenticate,clear-auth}`,
`/workspace/mcp/servers` (POST/DELETE), `/workspace/auth/device-flow`,
`/workspace/init`, `/session/:id/approval-mode`, `/session/:id/rewind`, and
`/session/:id/shell`.

Rewind remains REST-only in the TypeScript SDK even when an ACP transport is
configured. This preserves the strict mutation gate and bearer/client identity
headers; the ACP route table intentionally has no rewind mapping. Owner routing
also rechecks workspace trust before either rewind or shell reaches a secondary
runtime bridge. Duplicate live session ids fail closed as
`ambiguous_session_owner` instead of falling back to the primary runtime.

### `/health` exemption

On loopback binds, `/health` is registered **before** the bearer middleware so liveness probes inside the pod do not need to carry the token. Non-loopback binds gate `/health` behind bearer like every other route. `--require-auth` drops the exemption: `/health` requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on loopback too.

### v1 client identity (`X-Qwen-Client-Id`) is self-reported

The daemon validates only the format of `X-Qwen-Client-Id`
(`[A-Za-z0-9._:-]{1,128}`) and tracks attached client ids per session. It does
not currently perform proof-of-possession. A client that observes
`originatorClientId` on SSE can re-register the same id and impersonate that
originator in later requests.

Impact:

- `designated` — a remote caller can impersonate the originator and vote on a
  request intended only for the prompt originator.
- `consensus` — if the spoofed id was already in the `votersAtIssue` snapshot,
  it can vote.
- `local-only` is not affected because it gates on `fromLoopback`, which the
  daemon stamps from the connection remote address.
- `first-responder` is not affected because it is identity-agnostic.

A future pair-token mechanism will issue a per-session secret from
`POST /session`; `designated` / `consensus` votes will have to present it. Until
then, deployments that need a hardened designated policy should bind loopback
or run behind an authenticated reverse proxy. See
[`04-permission-mediation.md`](./04-permission-mediation.md) for policy-level
details.

### Device-flow auth

Separate OAuth surface for provider authentication. The v1 provider identifier is
`qwen-oauth`, but Qwen OAuth free tier was discontinued on 2026-04-15; new
setups should use a currently supported auth provider when one is available.

- `POST /workspace/auth/device-flow` — start a flow; returns `{deviceFlowId, providerId, expiresAt, verificationUrl, userCode}`.
- `GET /workspace/auth/device-flow/:id` — poll state.
- `DELETE /workspace/auth/device-flow/:id` — cancel.
- `GET /workspace/auth/status` — current account / provider snapshot.

SSE events `auth_device_flow_{started, throttled, authorized, failed, cancelled}` fan-out flow state to all subscribers so multi-client UIs stay in sync. See [`09-event-schema.md`](./09-event-schema.md).

Implementation: `packages/cli/src/serve/auth/device-flow.ts` + `qwen-device-flow-provider.ts`.

**Log injection / Trojan Source defense**: `sanitizeForStderr(value)`
(`device-flow.ts`) replaces ASCII control characters and Unicode control
characters with `?`. A malicious IdP could otherwise forge log lines or hide
payloads:

| Range                            | Why it is stripped                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Length is preserved by replacing each stripped code point with `?` rather than
deleting it, so operators can still see that something was present at that
index. Both layers use the sanitizer: `qwenDeviceFlowProvider` sanitizes IdP
`oauthError`, and the registry's late-poll observer sanitizes provider-controlled
values interpolated into audit hints (`latePollResult.kind` / `lateErr.name`).

The `auth_device_flow` capability tag is advertised **unconditionally**; the routes themselves return `400 unsupported_provider` if the daemon cannot satisfy a specific provider. The supported-providers list is on `/workspace/auth/status` rather than `/capabilities` to keep the descriptor shape uniform.

## Workflow

### Bearer auth successful request

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant C as Client
    participant BA as bearerAuth
    participant R as Route

    C->>BA: Authorization: Bearer abc...
    BA->>BA: parse scheme (case-insensitive), strip BWS
    BA->>BA: SHA-256(candidate)
    BA->>BA: timingSafeEqual(candidate, expected)
    BA->>R: next()
    R-->>C: 200 ...
```

### Bearer auth failure modes

All return `401 { error: 'Unauthorized' }` (uniform across `missing header` / `wrong scheme` / `wrong token` so probing cannot distinguish).

### `--require-auth` shadow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant C as Unauth client
    participant CAPS as GET /capabilities
    participant BA as bearerAuth

    C->>CAPS: GET /capabilities (no Authorization)
    CAPS->>BA: pass through middleware
    BA-->>C: 401 Unauthorized
    Note over C,BA: client cannot preflight require_auth tag<br/>before authenticating. Discovery surface is the 401 body.
```

After authenticating, `caps.features.includes('require_auth')` confirms the deployment is hardened.

### Wave 4 mutation gate on no-token loopback

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant C as Client
    participant BA as bearerAuth (no-op, no token)
    participant MG as mutationGate({strict: true})
    participant R as Handler

    C->>BA: POST /workspace/memory (no Authorization)
    BA->>MG: passthrough
    MG-->>C: 401 { code: 'token_required', error: '...' }
```

## State & Lifecycle

- Bearer token is read at boot and trimmed (newlines from `cat token.txt` would otherwise silently break comparison).
- Allowed-Host Set is cached per port; rebuilt on port change (ephemeral `0` → real port post-`listen`).
- Mutation gate constructs `passthrough` and `strictDenier` once per app build; per-route call returns the cached closure (no per-request allocation).
- Device-flow registry is disposed on `shutdown()` Phase 1 so pending flows resolve as `cancelled` before HTTP teardown.

## Dependencies

- `node:crypto` — `createHash`, `timingSafeEqual`.
- `packages/cli/src/serve/loopback-binds.ts` — `isLoopbackBind`.
- `packages/cli/src/serve/auth/device-flow.ts` — device-flow state machine.
- `@qwen-code/acp-bridge` — surfaces device-flow events on the per-session SSE bus.

## Caveats & Known Limits

- **`--require-auth` shadows feature preflight.** Unauthenticated clients cannot discover the `require_auth` tag; their discovery surface is the 401 body itself.
- **Mutation gate body-parser ordering**: `mutationGate({strict: true})` 401 responses fire **after** `express.json()` parses the body. Worst case on a saturated loopback listener: `--max-connections × express.json({limit: '10mb'})` ≈ 2.5 GB transient. Loopback-only attack surface, intentionally accepted.
- **Same-origin Origin stripping** in `server.ts` happens _before_ `allowOriginCors`. If a future change moves the strip elsewhere, the Web Shell breaks.
- **Token comparison is over the SHA-256 digest**, not the raw token. Reduces timing leakage by collapsing variable-length token compares to a fixed-size digest compare.
- The daemon does **not** carry mTLS, request signing, or pair-token proof-of-possession today. `--rate-limit` provides HTTP rate limiting by client-id / IP key; it is not client identity authentication.
