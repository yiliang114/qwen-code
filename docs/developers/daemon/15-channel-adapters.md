# Channel Adapters

## Overview

`packages/channels/` contains the **IM channel adapters** that turn a chat platform's incoming message into an agent prompt and send the agent response back to the chat platform. Four concrete channels ship today: DingTalk, WeChat (Weixin), Telegram, and Feishu. They share a base layer (`packages/channels/base/`) and an adapter-facing `ChannelAgentBridge` contract.

There are two current host modes:

- `qwen channel start [name]` is the standalone ACP-backed channel service. It passes adapters an `AcpBridge` implementation of `ChannelAgentBridge`.
- `qwen serve --channel <name>` and `qwen serve --channel all` are experimental daemon-managed modes. Named selections are grouped by owning workspace and `qwen serve` starts one out-of-process worker per owning runtime; each worker connects to the daemon through the SDK and adapters receive a `DaemonChannelBridge`-backed `ChannelAgentBridge` facade. `--channel all` remains a primary-only selection.

In daemon-managed mode, each channel maps inbound chat traffic to daemon sessions under a configurable `SessionScope` (`user`, `chat_thread`, or `single`). The legacy Channel value `thread` remains readable and editable for existing configurations, but new Web Shell configurations do not offer it; this is separate from the daemon bridge's own `single`/`thread` session creation knob. The adapter delegates to `DaemonChannelBridge`, which delegates to the SDK's `DaemonSessionClient` (see [`13-sdk-daemon-client.md`](./13-sdk-daemon-client.md)). Every named channel must resolve to one registered, trusted workspace. The worker uses that runtime's canonical cwd, `QWEN_DAEMON_WORKSPACE`, and environment overlay; ownership resolution never falls back to primary.

### Webhook-triggered channel tasks

Webhook-triggered tasks are hosted by `qwen serve` and executed inside the daemon-managed channel worker. The HTTP route validates the source and forwards a `ChannelWebhookTask` to the worker over IPC. The worker calls `ChannelBase.runWebhookTask()`, so adapters do not implement webhook parsing.

Adapters still participate through proactive send support: `supportsProactiveSend()` tells the host whether a channel can send without an inbound message, `supportsProactiveTarget()` handles delivery limits for specific target shapes, and `pushProactive()` carries the outbound content.

## Responsibilities

- Receive inbound messages from the channel's native transport (DingTalk WebSocket stream, WeChat HTTP long-poll, Telegram Bot long-poll, Feishu WebSocket or HTTP webhook).
- Resolve `(senderId, groupId?)` into a daemon session via `DaemonChannelSessionFactory`.
- Forward the user message as a daemon prompt and stream the response back as outbound chat messages, possibly chunked.
- Render permission requests as chat-native prompts when interactive; otherwise auto-approve according to `ChannelConfig.approvalMode`.
- Apply sender gating (allowlists / denylists), group gating, and content normalization (markdown / HTML per channel).

## Architecture

### `DaemonChannelBridge` (shared base, `packages/channels/base/src/DaemonChannelBridge.ts`)

```ts
class DaemonChannelBridge extends EventEmitter {
  constructor(opts: {
    cwd: string;
    sessionFactory: DaemonChannelSessionFactory;
    modelServiceId?: string;
    sessionScope?: SessionScope;
  });
  newSession(cwd: string): Promise<string>;
  loadSession(sessionId: string, cwd: string): Promise<string>;
  prompt(sessionId: string, text: string, options?): Promise<string>;
  cancelSession(sessionId: string): Promise<void>;
  stop(): void;
}
```

Holds daemon session clients keyed by daemon `sessionId`; `ChannelBase` and `SessionRouter` decide which inbound chat target maps to that session. Each attached session has:

- A `DaemonChannelSessionClient` (shape of `DaemonSessionClient` minus channel-irrelevant methods).
- A live SSE consumer pump.
- A debounced prompt assembler (for adapters that fragment user input across multiple inbound messages).
- An auto-approve policy per request.

Events emitted: `textChunk`, `toolCall`, `sessionUpdate`, `permissionRequest`, `permissionResolved`, `modelSwitched`, `modelSwitchFailed`, `sessionDied`, `promptComplete`, and `error`. Channel adapters wire these into platform-native APIs.

### `ChannelBase` (`packages/channels/base/src/ChannelBase.ts`)

Abstract base every adapter extends:

```ts
abstract class ChannelBase {
  abstract connect(): Promise<void>;
  abstract sendMessage(chatId: string, text: string): Promise<void>;
  abstract disconnect(): void;
  handleInbound(envelope: Envelope): Promise<void>; // → SessionRouter.resolve + bridge.prompt
}
```

All internal message delivery routes through `sendThreadMessage(chatId, threadId, text)`. The default implementation falls through to `sendMessage(chatId, text)`, ignoring `threadId` — IM adapters are unaffected. Polling adapters (e.g. GitHub) override `sendThreadMessage` to post comments on a specific issue/PR using the `threadId`.

Handles common cross-cutting concerns: sender gating (allowlist / denylist), group gating, message block streaming (chunk size, throttling), inbound debounce.

### Per-channel adapters

| Adapter         | File                                                | Transport                                              | Notes                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DingTalk        | `packages/channels/dingtalk/src/DingtalkAdapter.ts` | DingTalk Stream SDK WebSocket                          | Sends via `sessionWebhook` POST; media images downloaded via DT API, base64 in envelope.                                                      |
| WeChat (Weixin) | `packages/channels/weixin/src/WeixinAdapter.ts`     | iLink Bot HTTP long-poll                               | Sends via proprietary `sendText` / `sendImage` API; typing indicators.                                                                        |
| Telegram        | `packages/channels/telegram/src/TelegramAdapter.ts` | Telegram Bot API long-poll (grammy)                    | Sends HTML chunks via `sendMessage`.                                                                                                          |
| Feishu          | `packages/channels/feishu/src/FeishuAdapter.ts`     | Feishu/Lark Stream WebSocket (default) or HTTP webhook | Sends via Lark SDK as interactive cards; webhook mode requires `encryptKey` for HMAC signature verification.                                  |
| GitHub          | `packages/channels/github/src/GithubAdapter.ts`     | GitHub Notifications API polling (`@octokit/rest`)     | Extends `PollingChannelBase`; cursor-based comment window dedup; posts comments via Issues API.                                               |
| GitLab          | `packages/channels/gitlab/src/GitlabAdapter.ts`     | GitLab Todos API polling (`@gitbeaker/rest`)           | Extends `PollingChannelBase`; dispatches `todo.body` directly; `action_prompt_template` config drives event filtering and metadata rendering. |

Each adapter implements:

1. Inbound transport (subscribe / poll for messages).
2. Envelope construction (`{ senderId, groupId?, text, media?, raw }`).
3. Sender / group gating (delegates to `ChannelBase`).
4. Outbound serialization (markdown → HTML / WeChat-native / DingTalk-native).
5. Lifecycle (start / shutdown).

### Adapter matrix

| Adapter      | Transport                       | Identity                                                 | Permission UX                       | Auto-approve config                               |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **DingTalk** | WebSocket stream                | `senderStaffId` (+ optional `conversationId` for groups) | Inline buttons via DT markdown      | `ChannelConfig.approvalMode = 'auto' \| 'prompt'` |
| **WeChat**   | HTTP long-poll                  | `senderWxid` (+ optional `groupWxid`)                    | Text-only prompts with reply tokens | Same                                              |
| **Telegram** | Bot API long-poll               | `from.id` (+ optional `chat.id` for groups)              | Inline keyboard buttons             | Same                                              |
| **Feishu**   | WebSocket stream / HTTP webhook | `sender.open_id` (+ optional `chat_id` for groups)       | Interactive card buttons            | Same                                              |
| **GitHub**   | Notifications API polling       | Numeric `user.id` (immutable; login resolved at connect) | Error comment + re-mention          | `senderPolicy: 'allowlist' \| 'open'`             |
| **GitLab**   | Todos API polling               | `author.username` (lowercased)                           | Log + re-mention                    | `senderPolicy: 'allowlist' \| 'open'`             |

> **Note:** The "Permission UX" column describes each platform's native affordance, but none is wired up yet — `AcpBridge.requestPermission` currently auto-approves every request (`packages/channels/base/src/AcpBridge.ts`), and `ChannelConfig.approvalMode` is declared but not yet read. Interactive approval is planned (Phase 5).

    end
```

## State & Lifecycle

- `DaemonChannelBridge` lives for the lifetime of the channel adapter; sessions inside it live according to the configured `SessionScope`.
- Each active session reconnects automatically if SSE drops — `DaemonSessionClient.events()` tracks `lastSeenEventId` so replay is correct.
- `shutdown()` closes every active session and the underlying transport (the channel's WebSocket / long-poll).
- DingTalk's WebSocket stream supports server-push; WeChat's long-poll requires a backoff strategy on idle responses; Telegram's long-poll has a built-in `timeout` parameter.

### Runtime selection and settings reload

The long-lived `ChannelWorkerManager` owns the committed daemon selection and workspace-grouped supervisors. A daemon may boot without `--channel`; the first strict-gated `PUT /workspace/channel` dynamically loads the channel runtime, reserves the service pidfile, resolves workspace ownership, and starts the selected workers. `GET /workspace/channel` reads the manager snapshot and `DELETE /workspace/channel` stops it idempotently. SDK helpers are `getChannelWorkerControl()`, `setChannelWorkerSelection()`, and `stopChannelWorker()`; the CLI entry is `qwen channel set` plus remote `status` and `stop` variants.

The daemon reads channel settings from `settings.json` when each worker starts (`packages/cli/src/commands/channel/daemon-worker.ts` → `loadSettings` → `loadChannelsConfig`). `POST /workspace/channel/reload` re-reads those settings and force-reconciles the committed selection. All lifecycle mutations share one FIFO lane. Unchanged workspace groups survive ordinary selection replacement; changed groups stop and start sequentially while the serve-owned PID lease remains held.

If a replacement fails, newly started workers are stopped and old workers are restored before the request returns. A supervisor that cannot observe exit after SIGTERM and SIGKILL retains its child reference and fails stop; the manager keeps the PID lease and never starts a second worker. Webhook configuration and routing change only when selection commit succeeds. Runtime selections are process-local and disappear on daemon restart.

Adapter `connect()` failures are reported separately from worker lifecycle errors. The worker sends each bounded, credential-redacted failure over startup IPC and waits for a supervisor acknowledgement before trying the next adapter. A partially connected worker remains running and exposes `startupFailures` in its snapshot. If every adapter in a dynamic attempt fails, the `502 channel_worker_start_failed` response carries workspace-annotated attempted failures while `state` reflects the rollback result; subsequent GET responses do not retain the attempt. Daemon boot with no connected adapter remains fail-fast. The optional adapter `code` is diagnostic only, and the current `phase` is `connect`.

## Dependencies

- `packages/channels/base/` — `ChannelBase`, `PollingChannelBase`, `DaemonChannelBridge`, `types.ts` (`ChannelConfig`, `Envelope`, `SessionScope`, `ChannelPlugin`).
- `packages/sdk-typescript/src/daemon/` — `DaemonSessionClient` and friends.
- Per-channel SDKs: `@dingtalk/stream` (DingTalk), proprietary iLink Bot HTTP (Weixin), `grammy` (Telegram), `@octokit/rest` (GitHub polling), `@gitbeaker/rest` (GitLab polling).

## Configuration

`ChannelConfig` (from `packages/channels/base/src/types.ts`):

| Knob                                     | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `sessionScope`                           | `'user'` (sender + chat), `'chat_thread'` (channel + chatId + threadId), or `'single'` (one shared session per channel). Legacy `'thread'` is preserved when already configured but is not offered for new Web Shell configurations. |
| `approvalMode`                           | `'auto'` (auto-respond) / `'prompt'` (render UI).                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `allowlist?: string[]`                   | Sender ids allowed; missing = open.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `denylist?: string[]`                    | Sender ids denied.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `chunkSize`, `chunkIntervalMs`           | Outbound block streaming settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `daemon: { baseUrl, token?, clientId? }` | Forwarded to `DaemonChannelSessionFactory`.                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Channel-specific keys layer on top (DingTalk: `streamCredentials`; WeChat: `ilinkUrl`, `botId`; Telegram: `botToken`; Feishu: `clientId` (appId), `clientSecret` (appSecret), `verificationToken`, `encryptKey` (webhook mode)).

## Caveats & Known Limits

- **Channels do not directly import `@qwen-code/sdk`.** They go through `ChannelBase` → `DaemonChannelBridge` → `DaemonChannelSessionClient` (which the bridge constructs from the SDK). The indirection lets the bridge swap implementations, such as a test stub, without requiring channel changes.
- **Permission UX is per-channel.** DingTalk uses markdown buttons; WeChat is text-only; Telegram uses inline keyboards; Feishu uses interactive card buttons. (All currently auto-approve via `AcpBridge`; interactive approval is planned.) No common "interactive permission widget" abstraction yet.
- **Auto-approve is a deployment-side decision**, not a daemon-side one. The daemon's `permission_mediation` policy still applies; auto-approve only means the channel responds without prompting the human. Do not combine `auto` with `enforce`-grade workflows.
- **Per-channel rate limits / message-size limits are the adapter's job.** `DaemonChannelBridge` only handles chunking; pushing past WeChat's per-message size or Telegram's flood limit is on the adapter.
- **No DingTalk / WeChat / Telegram / Feishu reverse-call** — channels are one-way (chat → daemon → chat). The IM platform's native push path, such as a DingTalk card callback, is not wired into the bridge yet.
