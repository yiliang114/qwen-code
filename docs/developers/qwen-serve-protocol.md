# `qwen serve` HTTP protocol reference

Stage 1 of the [qwen-code daemon design](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/3803). All routes live under the daemon's base URL (default `http://127.0.0.1:4170`).

## Authentication

When the daemon was started with `--token` or `QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN`, **every route except `/health` on loopback binds** must carry:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Without a configured token (loopback dev default) the header is optional. Token comparison is constant-time. 401 responses are uniform across `missing header` / `wrong scheme` / `wrong token`.

**`/health` exemption** (Bctum): on loopback binds (`127.0.0.1` / `localhost` / `::1` / `[::1]`) `/health` is registered BEFORE the bearer middleware, so liveness probes inside the pod don't need to carry the token even when the daemon was started with `--token`. Non-loopback binds (`--hostname 0.0.0.0` etc.) gate `/health` behind the bearer like every other route — see the [`GET /health`](#get-health) section for the rationale.

**`--require-auth` (#4175 PR 15).** Pass this flag at boot to extend the "must have a token" rule to loopback as well. Boot fails without a token; the `/health` exemption is dropped (so `/health` also requires `Authorization: Bearer …`).

When the flag is on, the global `bearerAuth` middleware gates **every** route — including `/capabilities`. An **unauthenticated** client therefore cannot pre-flight `caps.features` to discover that auth is required: the discovery surface for that case is the **401 response body** itself (uniform across all routes per the [Authentication](#authentication) section). The `require_auth` capability tag is a **post-authentication confirmation** — once a client successfully authenticates and reads `/capabilities`, the tag's presence confirms the daemon was started with `--require-auth` (useful for audit / compliance UIs and for SDK clients to surface "this deployment is hardened" in a settings panel). Mutation routes that opt into per-route strict mode (Wave 4 follow-ups) refuse with `401 { code: "token_required", error: "…" }` when reached on a no-token loopback default — but with `--require-auth` enabled the global bearer middleware short-circuits the request before the per-route gate, so the legacy `Unauthorized` body is what unauthenticated callers actually see.

**`--allow-origin <pattern>` (T2.4 [#4514](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/4514)).** Browser webuis hitting the daemon cross-origin are blocked by default — any request carrying an `Origin` header returns `403 {"error":"Request denied by CORS policy"}` because CLI/SDK clients never send `Origin` and the daemon treats its presence as a sign the request came from a browser context the operator has not opted into. Pass `--allow-origin <pattern>` (repeatable) at boot to install an allowlist instead of the wall. Each pattern is either:

- The literal `*` — admit any origin. **Risky**: boot refuses when `*` is configured but no bearer token is set (any source: `--token`, `QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN`, or `--require-auth` which mandates a token at boot). The boot breadcrumb emits a stderr warning when `*` is in the list. **Recommendation**: pair with `--require-auth` on loopback binds so `/health` is also gated by the bearer — it's registered before the bearer middleware on loopback by default (so k8s/Compose probes can reach it without a token), and a `*` allowlist makes it reachable from any cross-origin browser. `--require-auth` still leaves the Web Shell static assets (`/`, `/assets/*`, and `/session/:id` document navigations) pre-auth on loopback by design — they are mounted before the bearer middleware — so under a `*` allowlist they remain readable from any cross-origin browser; `--no-web` removes that surface. On non-loopback binds the bearer is already mandatory at boot and `/health` is registered behind it, so the only surface `*` exposes without a token is the Web Shell static assets (`/`, `/assets/*`, and `/session/:id` document navigations — their JS still calls token-gated routes). `--no-web` removes even that; the actual API surface is gated regardless.
- A canonical URL origin — `<scheme>://<host>[:<port>]`. **No trailing slash, no path, no userinfo, no query.** Boot refuses with `InvalidAllowOriginPatternError` if the entry fails the round-trip `new URL(pattern).origin === pattern`; the error message names the bad pattern and the canonical form. Strict-by-intent: silent normalization (e.g. trimming a trailing `/`) would let typos slip through and accept ambiguous input.

Matched origins receive the standard CORS response headers on every request:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <echoed origin>
Vary: Origin
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization, Content-Type, X-Qwen-Client-Id, Last-Event-ID, X-Qwen-Event-Epoch
Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Retry-After, X-Qwen-Event-Epoch, X-Qwen-SSE-Stream-Id
```

`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` echoes the request's origin verbatim (lowercase / uppercase as the browser sent it) rather than the literal `*`, even under the `*` pattern — browser caches key responses on it paired with `Vary: Origin`, and echoing leaves room to add `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` in a later release without a schema change. The exposed headers let browser webuis honor retry hints, retain the SSE epoch, and correlate accepted physical streams. `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` is **NOT** sent today: the daemon authenticates via bearer-in-`Authorization`, which works cross-origin without `credentials: 'include'`.

OPTIONS preflight requests (OPTIONS with `Access-Control-Request-Method` or `Access-Control-Request-Headers`) short-circuit with `204 No Content` plus the headers above. This is the conventional CORS pattern and is safe — the preflight only confirms which methods/headers the daemon will accept; the actual subsequent request still runs the full chain (host allowlist → bearer auth → routes), so anti-DNS-rebinding and bearer enforcement still fire before any state is read or mutated. Plain OPTIONS requests from matched origins keep flowing downstream with CORS headers attached.

Origins that don't match the allowlist still get `403 {"error":"Request denied by CORS policy"}` — same envelope as the default wall, so clients that already parsed the wall's response don't have to special-case allowlist-deployed daemons. The reject path **does not** emit any `Access-Control-*` headers (the browser would ignore them, and emitting would indirectly advertise the allowlist size through header presence).

The configured pattern list is intentionally NOT echoed in `/capabilities` — browser webui already knows its own origin (it called the daemon, after all), and surfacing the list would let an unauthenticated reader of `/capabilities` enumerate every trusted origin (useful recon for a misconfigured deployment). SDK clients gate on the `caps.features.allow_origin` tag for "this daemon honors cross-origin browser hits" without needing to know which specific origins.

Loopback self-origin requests (e.g. the Web Shell calling the daemon at the same `127.0.0.1:port`) are handled by a **separate** Origin-strip shim that runs BEFORE the CORS middleware and removes the `Origin` header for `127.0.0.1:port` / `localhost:port` / `[::1]:port` / `host.docker.internal:port`. So they pass through regardless of `--allow-origin` configuration — operators don't need to list the daemon's own port to make the Web Shell work.

## Common error shape

5xx responses carry the original error's `code` and `data` when present (JSON-RPC style — the ACP SDK forwards `{code, message, data}` from the agent):

```json
{
  "error": "Internal error",
  "code": -32000,
  "data": { "reason": "model quota exceeded" }
}
```

Malformed JSON in a request body returns:

```json
{ "error": "Invalid JSON in request body" }
```

with status `400`.

`SessionNotFoundError` for an unknown session id returns:

```json
{
  "error": "No session with id \"<sid>\"",
  "sessionId": "<sid>",
  "code": "session_not_found"
}
```

with status `404`. A concurrent close uses `code: "session_closing"`.

`WorkspaceMismatchError` for a `POST /session` whose `cwd` doesn't canonicalize to a registered workspace returns `400` with:

```json
{
  "error": "Workspace mismatch: daemon is bound to \"…\"",
  "code": "workspace_mismatch",
  "boundWorkspace": "/path/the/daemon/uses/as-primary",
  "requestedWorkspace": "/path/in/the/request"
}
```

Use this to detect mismatch pre-flight: read `workspaceCwd` off `/capabilities` and omit `cwd` from `POST /session` (it falls back to the primary workspace), or when `multi_workspace_sessions` is advertised choose one of `workspaces[].cwd`.

`POST /session` past the daemon's `--max-sessions` cap returns `503` with a `Retry-After: 5` header and:

```json
{
  "error": "Session limit reached (20)",
  "code": "session_limit_exceeded",
  "limit": 20,
  "scope": "workspace"
}
```

When `--max-total-sessions` rejects a fresh session, the same response shape is returned with `"scope": "total"`.

Attaches to existing sessions are NOT counted toward the cap, so an idle daemon's reconnects keep working even when at-capacity.

`RestoreInProgressError` — emitted by `POST /session/:id/load`, `POST /session/:id/resume`, or a caller-supplied-id `POST /session` when another registration already owns that id — returns `409` and:

```json
{
  "error": "Session \"<sid>\" is already being restored via session/<resume|load>; retry session/<load|resume> after it completes",
  "code": "restore_in_progress",
  "reason": "restore_in_progress",
  "retryable": true,
  "sessionId": "<sid>",
  "activeAction": "load",
  "requestedAction": "resume"
}
```

Fired when a `session/load` is issued for an id that already has a `session/resume` in flight (or vice versa), or when a caller-supplied-id spawn races either restore direction. Wait at least `Retry-After` seconds and retry. Same-action races (`load` vs `load`, `resume` vs `resume`) coalesce instead of erroring while the restore is active.

`reason` distinguishes two fences that share this code, and the `Retry-After` header tracks it:

| `reason`                     | Meaning                                                                                                          | `Retry-After`                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `restore_in_progress`        | An ordinary restore is running.                                                                                  | `5` (matching `session_limit_exceeded`)                       |
| `awaiting_abandoned_cleanup` | The public caller already got a `504` and the non-cancellable ACP request plus its cleanup have not settled yet. | the effective restore budget in seconds, clamped to `5`–`120` |

The public restore request is governed by `limits.sessionRestoreTimeoutMs` (default 60s). After a `504` the id stays fenced until the late ACP request and cleanup settle, so a client that keeps retrying at the ordinary 5-second cadence would spin against a 409 it cannot clear — honor the budget-derived hint that comes with `awaiting_abandoned_cleanup`.

`SessionWorkspaceConflictError` — emitted by `POST /session/:id/load` and `POST /session/:id/resume` when the requested `cwd` targets one registered workspace but the same session id is already live or being restored by another runtime — returns `409` with:

```json
{
  "error": "Session \"<sid>\" is already live or restoring in another workspace runtime.",
  "code": "session_workspace_conflict",
  "sessionId": "<sid>",
  "workspaceCwd": "/requested/workspace",
  "workspaceId": "requested-workspace-id",
  "liveWorkspaceCwd": "/live/owner/workspace",
  "liveWorkspaceId": "live-owner-workspace-id"
}
```

Clients should retry with the owning workspace or wait for the in-flight restore to finish before restoring the id into a different workspace. Same-workspace restore races continue to use the bridge's `restore_in_progress` / coalescing behavior.

`SessionArchivedError` is emitted when a caller tries to load or resume a session whose JSONL is under `chats/archive/`:

```json
{
  "error": "Session \"<sid>\" is archived. Unarchive it before loading.",
  "code": "session_archived",
  "sessionId": "<sid>"
}
```

with status `409`.

`SessionArchivingError` is emitted when a session archive or unarchive transition is already in flight for the same id:

```json
{
  "error": "Session \"<sid>\" is being archived or unarchived; retry later.",
  "code": "session_archiving",
  "sessionId": "<sid>"
}
```

with status `409` and `Retry-After: 5`.

## Capabilities

The daemon advertises its supported feature tags from the serve capability
registry. Clients **must** gate UI off `features`, not off `mode` (per design
§10).

```

> Conditional tags appear only when their matching deployment toggle is on (see the table below). F3's `permission_mediation` tag is always-on and carries `modes: ['first-responder', 'designated', 'consensus', 'local-only']` so SDK clients can introspect the build-supported set; the runtime-active strategy is at `body.policy.permission`.

`session_scope_override` is the negotiation handle for the per-request `sessionScope` field on `POST /session` (see below). Older daemons silently ignore the field, so SDK clients should pre-flight `caps.features` for this tag before sending it.

`session_id_override` is the negotiation handle for the optional caller-supplied `sessionId` on `POST /session` and ACP `session/new` metadata. Clients must confirm that `caps.features` contains this tag before sending the field because older daemons may silently ignore it.

`persistent_workspace_registration` advertises durable registration for workspaces added at runtime. `POST /workspaces` accepts `{ "cwd": "/absolute/path", "persist": true }`; success includes `persisted: true`. Registrations are scoped to the daemon's canonical primary workspace under the user's Qwen home and are restored on the next daemon start. Omitting `persist` preserves process-local registration. `GET /workspace-registrations` lists the stored desired set, and `DELETE /workspace-registrations/:id` forgets an entry for the next restart without hot-removing an active runtime.

`workspace_display_name` advertises optional `displayName` input on `POST /workspaces`, workspace metadata updates through `PATCH /workspaces/:workspace`, and optional display-name fields in workspace projections. Names do not participate in lookup or routing: `id` and canonical `cwd` remain the only selectors, and duplicate names are allowed.

`workspace_runtime_removal` advertises synchronous hot removal through `DELETE /workspaces/:workspace`. Capability workspace entries add optional `removable`; only rows with `removable: true` may be removed. Removal also forgets every persistent registration alias for the runtime, but never deletes files, settings, transcripts, or archives.

`session_load` and `session_resume` advertise the explicit-restore routes (`POST /session/:id/load` and `POST /session/:id/resume`). Older daemons return `404` for these paths, so SDK clients should pre-flight `caps.features` before calling. `unstable_session_resume` is still advertised as a deprecated alias for compatibility with SDKs that shipped while the underlying ACP method was named `connection.unstable_resumeSession`; new clients should gate on `session_resume`.

`limits.sessionRestoreTimeoutMs`, when present, is the daemon's wall-clock budget for the underlying ACP `loadSession` / `unstable_resumeSession` request. It is an additive v1 field. The TypeScript SDK gives the daemon 10 seconds of client headroom, and the WebUI watchdog gives it 15 seconds; clients talking to an older daemon should use 70 seconds and 75 seconds respectively.

`session_transcript` advertises `GET /session/:id/transcript`, a read-only paged replay view over the persisted active-session JSONL. It is separate from `/load`: it does not attach a client, seed the live EventBus, create a live session, or change the live replay window. Clients should use it when they need the complete on-disk transcript for a long session, and continue using `/load` only for bounded live replay during cold UI restore.

`workspace_persisted_transcript` advertises `GET /workspaces/:workspace/session/:id/transcript`, a daemon-local persisted-only pager that does not start ACP, query live bridge state, load settings, discover project capabilities, or create the legacy persisted cursor key. The tag is unconditional because trusted single-workspace primaries can use the plural route; per-workspace trust authorization is still evaluated on every request. Registered untrusted secondary workspaces may read, while an untrusted primary remains rejected.

`workspace_session_export` advertises `GET /workspaces/:workspace/session/:id/export`, a trusted-only full export of the selected workspace's active persisted session. It is independent of `session_export` and `workspace_qualified_rest_core`: released daemons can advertise both older tags without implementing the plural route, so clients must pre-flight this tag directly. The tag is unconditional because a trusted single-workspace primary can use the route by id or cwd. The export does not resolve a live owner, start ACP, attach a client, or fall back to another workspace.

`workspace_archived_session_export` advertises `GET /workspaces/:workspace/session/:id/archive/export`, a trusted-only full export from the selected workspace's archived persisted storage. It is independent of `workspace_session_export` and `workspace_qualified_rest_core`; clients must pre-flight this tag directly. A distinct route prevents an older daemon from ignoring archive intent and returning an active transcript with the same id.

`workspace_session_live_state` advertises `GET /workspaces/:workspace/sessions/live-state`, a trusted-only, memory-only snapshot of the selected workspace runtime's live sessions plus an in-memory catalog version that tells clients when a full persisted-catalog reload is warranted. It is independent of `workspace_qualified_rest_core`: released daemons can advertise the broader workspace REST capability without implementing this route, so clients must pre-flight this tag directly. The tag is unconditional because a trusted single-workspace primary can use the route by id or cwd; per-workspace trust checks still apply on every request, and the route does not extend the permissive untrusted-secondary persisted-catalog read policy to live bridge state.

`slow_client_warning` covers SSE backpressure behavior: (a) the daemon emits a `slow_client_warning` synthetic event-stream frame when a subscriber's live frame backlog or live serialized-byte backlog crosses 75% full, once per overflow episode (rearmed after both measurements drain below 37.5%); (b) `GET /session/:id/events` accepts a `?maxQueued=N` query param (range `[16, 2048]`) to pre-size the per-subscriber frame backlog for cold reconnects against a large replay ring. The serialized-byte cap is daemon-owned (default **2 MiB** per subscriber), live-only, and intentionally has no query parameter. The daemon-wide ring size is controlled by `--event-ring-size` (default **8000**, per #3803 §02). Old daemons silently lack the warning/query behavior — pre-flight this tag before opting in.

`typed_event_schema` advertises daemon event payloads that match the SDK's `KnownDaemonEvent` schema. Older daemons may still stream compatible frames, but SDK clients should pre-flight this tag before assuming typed event coverage.

`client_heartbeat` advertises `POST /session/:id/heartbeat`. Older daemons return `404`; pre-flight this tag before issuing periodic heartbeats.

`session_close` and `session_metadata` advertise `DELETE /session/:id` and `PATCH /session/:id/metadata`. Older daemons return `404`; pre-flight these tags before exposing close or rename affordances.

`session_organization` advertises custom session groups and pinning. It adds `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /workspace/:id/session-groups`, `PATCH /session/:id/organization`, and the opt-in organized list view `GET /workspace/:id/sessions?view=organized`. When both `session_organization` and `workspace_qualified_rest_core` are advertised, the workspace-qualified organization mutation `PATCH /workspaces/:workspace/session/:id/organization` is also available. The legacy mutation remains primary-workspace-only. Older daemons return `404` for the mutation/group routes and ignore the organized view contract, so WebShell/SDK clients must pre-flight these tags before showing the matching grouping or pinning UI.

`session_archive` advertises the v1 directory-state archive API: `POST /sessions/archive`, `POST /sessions/unarchive`, and `GET /workspace/:id/sessions?archiveState=active|archived`. Archived sessions cannot be loaded or resumed until they are unarchived.

`workspace_qualified_rest_core` advertises plural core REST routes under `/workspaces/:workspace/...`. The selector resolves as exact workspace id first, then as a URL-encoded absolute cwd after canonicalization. Newer single-workspace daemons include the primary runtime in `workspaces[]` even when `multi_workspace_sessions` is absent, allowing clients to discover the id required by workspace-qualified routes; clients should fall back to `capabilities.workspaceCwd` for older daemons that omit the array. Trust status and trust request routes are available for registered untrusted workspaces; file read routes follow the existing filesystem read policy. Registered untrusted secondary workspaces also expose persisted-only session and session-group catalogs: these reads do not attach to a session, start ACP, or merge live bridge state. File writes, catalog mutations, and other plural core routes require a trusted workspace unless a separate capability explicitly defines a narrower read-only policy, such as `workspace_persisted_transcript`. An untrusted primary continues to receive `403 { code: "untrusted_workspace" }` from the plural catalog and transcript routes; legacy singular primary routes keep their existing compatibility behavior. This tag covers the core file, status, settings, permissions, trust, lifecycle, MCP control, tool and skill toggles, memory, workspace agent CRUD, and session storage surfaces. It does not cover auth, voice, extensions, ACP/WebSocket transport, channel-worker routing, or workspace-qualified session export; pre-flight `workspace_session_export` or `workspace_archived_session_export` separately. Workspace trust is not an ACL: a client holding the daemon token can read every registered workspace surface allowed by this policy.

`workspace_qualified_voice` advertises Voice routes selected by a trusted workspace runtime: `GET` and `POST /workspaces/:workspace/voice`, `POST /workspaces/:workspace/voice/transcribe`, and `WS /workspaces/:workspace/voice/stream`. It is advertised only when multi-workspace runtimes and the shared ACP/Voice WebSocket listener are both enabled. The selector follows the same id-or-encoded-absolute-cwd rules as other plural routes. For REST, an unknown selector returns `400 { code: "workspace_mismatch" }` and an untrusted selector returns `403 { code: "untrusted_workspace" }`; WebSocket upgrade rejection exposes the corresponding HTTP 400/403 status without a structured JSON envelope. Neither transport falls back to primary. Legacy `/workspace/voice`, `/workspace/voice/transcribe`, and `/voice/stream` remain primary-only. Clients use `workspace_qualified_voice` for all qualified Voice modalities and let the selected runtime report configuration-specific errors. The legacy `workspace_voice`, `workspace_voice_transcription`, and `voice_transcribe` tags describe only the primary-bound routes and must not hide a qualified secondary configuration.

`workspace_qualified_memory` advertises the workspace-qualified managed-memory routes: `POST /workspaces/:workspace/memory/{remember,forget,dream}` enqueue tasks and `GET /workspaces/:workspace/memory/{remember,forget,dream}/:taskId` reads them back. It is advertised only when ACP HTTP and multi-workspace runtimes are both enabled. The selector follows the same id-or-encoded-absolute-cwd rules as other plural routes. Each registered workspace gets its own task lane; the primary's qualified lane is the same instance as the singular `/workspace/memory` surface, so a task enqueued on one is readable on the other. Resolution is strictly per selected runtime with no primary fallback: an unknown selector returns `400 { code: "workspace_mismatch" }`, an untrusted selector returns `403 { code: "untrusted_workspace" }`, and an inactive or draining runtime returns `503 { code: "workspace_runtime_unavailable" }`. Reads never allocate a lane, so polling a workspace that has no tasks returns `404 { code: "<kind>_task_not_found" }`. Task ids are scoped to their lane and do not survive a workspace reconfiguration or runtime replacement; a stale id returns `404`, not a data-loss condition. When ACP HTTP is disabled the tag is not advertised and a non-primary qualified request returns a non-retryable `501 { code: "workspace_memory_unavailable" }`, while the primary qualified route keeps working through the locally-owned lane.

`session_lsp` advertises `GET /session/:id/lsp`, the read-only structured LSP status snapshot for daemon clients. Older daemons return `404`; pre-flight this tag before exposing remote LSP status.

`session_status` advertises `GET /session/:id/status`, the live bridge summary for a single session by id. In addition to `clientCount` and `hasActivePrompt`, live sessions expose `isWaitingForPermission`, `isWaitingForUserQuestion`, `pendingInteractionCount`, and a retained `turnError` after a failed turn. The error clears when the next prompt actually starts. Both the single-session status response and workspace session lists include `turnError` and `pendingInteractions`: render-ready permission actions or `ask_user_question` questions plus the `requestId` and selectable options required by the existing permission vote routes. Each user question has an `answerKey`; vote with `answers`, for example `{ "0": "Polling" }`, keyed by that value. Persisted-only sessions omit runtime state because no runtime exists. Older daemons return `404`; pre-flight this tag before polling a single session's status instead of scanning the full session list.

`session_info` advertises `GET /workspace/:id/session-info` and its `/workspaces/:workspace/session-info` twin. The response aggregates persisted active and archived session counts without hydrating list metadata. It is an explicit O(n) disk scan and must not be polled; clients should treat `truncated: true` as a lower-bound result.

`session_approval_mode_control`, `workspace_tool_toggle`, `workspace_skill_toggle`, `workspace_skill_batch_toggle`, `workspace_init`, and `workspace_mcp_restart` advertise the mutation control routes documented below. They are strict-gated by the mutation gate (a daemon configured without a bearer token rejects them with 401 `token_required`). Older daemons return `404`; pre-flight each tag before exposing the corresponding affordance.

`mcp_guardrails` (issue [#4175](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/4175) PR 14) covers the MCP budget surface: the `clientCount` / `clientBudget` / `budgetMode` / `budgets[]` fields on `GET /workspace/mcp`, the `disabledReason` field on per-server cells, and the `--mcp-client-budget` / `--mcp-budget-mode` CLI flags. Older daemons omit the new fields entirely; SDK clients pre-flight this tag before relying on `budgets[]` semantics. The registry descriptor also carries `modes: ['warn', 'enforce']` for future feature-modes exposure — for now, clients infer mode from the snapshot's `budgetMode` field. Server refusal under `enforce` mode is deterministic by `Object.entries(mcpServers)` declaration order; a future scope-precedence layer (if qwen-code adopts one) would shift this to "lowest-precedence first" to mirror claude-code's `plugin < user < project < local` convention.

> **Scope is capability-driven.** With `mcp_workspace_pool`, sessions inside one workspace runtime share a transport pool and `WorkspaceMcpBudget`, and the snapshot emits `budgets[0].scope: 'workspace'`. Different workspace runtimes own independent pools. Without the tag, each ACP session uses its legacy `McpClientManager`, the snapshot emits `scope: 'session'`, and N sessions may each consume the configured cap.

`workspace_file_read` covers the text/list/stat/glob workspace file routes
(`GET /file`, `GET /list`, `GET /glob`, `GET /stat`). `workspace_file_bytes`
covers `GET /file/bytes`, which was added later so clients can pre-flight raw
byte-window support against PR19-era daemons. `workspace_file_write` covers
the hash-aware text mutation routes (`POST /file/write`, `POST /file/edit`).
The write tag means the route contract exists; it does not mean the current
deployment is open for anonymous mutation. Write/edit are strict mutation
routes and require a configured bearer token even on loopback.
`workspace_file_upload` covers `POST /file/upload`, the binary ingress route:
an `application/octet-stream` body capped at `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` (50 MiB) is
written into the workspace without ever overwriting — an occupied name is
auto-numbered (`name (1).ext`, `name (2).ext`, ...). It is also a strict
mutation route.

When `workspace_qualified_rest_core` is advertised, the same file surface is also available at `/workspaces/:workspace/file`, `/workspaces/:workspace/file/bytes`, `/workspaces/:workspace/stat`, `/workspaces/:workspace/list`, `/workspaces/:workspace/glob`, `/workspaces/:workspace/file/write`, `/workspaces/:workspace/file/edit`, and `/workspaces/:workspace/file/upload`.

The same tag also exposes workspace-qualified project-agent CRUD at `/workspaces/:workspace/agents` and `/workspaces/:workspace/agents/:agentType`. These plural routes only read or mutate project-level agents for the selected workspace; `global` and `user` scope requests return `400 { code: "global_scope_not_supported_for_workspace_route" }`. Workspace-less `/workspace/agents` routes retain their existing primary-workspace behavior and remain the only REST surface for user-level agent scope.

`extension_management_v2` advertises a user-level extension catalog and mutation surface at `/extensions/*`, plus workspace activation projections at `/workspaces/:workspace/extensions/*`. Artifacts are global; workspace routes expose only projection reads, exact activation overrides, and runtime refresh. Reads may target an untrusted registered workspace, while activation, refresh, and workspace-scoped install require a trusted target. Slow mutations use daemon-local operations at `/extensions/operations/:operationId`; store generation, not operation history, is authoritative across restart and across daemons. The published `workspace_extensions` capability and `/workspace/extensions/*` routes remain a primary-workspace compatibility adapter. Clients must preflight `extension_management_v2` and must not infer it from daemon mode or `workspace_qualified_rest_core`.

### Extension Management V2 wire contract

All routes use the daemon bearer authentication rules above. `X-Qwen-Client-Id` is optional for the V2 mutation routes; when supplied, it must identify a client registered with one of the mutation's target workspace runtimes. `:extensionId` is the lowercase 64-hex extension identity. `:workspace` resolves as an exact workspace id first and otherwise as a URL-encoded absolute cwd after canonicalization.

The global catalog response is:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "generation": 12,
  "extensions": [
    {
      "id": "<64 lowercase hex characters>",
      "name": "demo",
      "version": "1.2.3",
      "installType": "npm",
      "defaultActivation": "enabled",
      "workspaceOverrideCount": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

`installType` is omitted when no install metadata is available. `defaultActivation` is `enabled` or `disabled`. `workspaceOverrideCount` excludes stored `inherit` entries.

The workspace projection response is:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "workspaceId": "workspace-id",
  "workspaceCwd": "/absolute/workspace",
  "trusted": true,
  "desiredGeneration": 12,
  "appliedGeneration": 11,
  "extensions": [
    {
      "extensionId": "<64 lowercase hex characters>",
      "name": "demo",
      "version": "1.2.3",
      "defaultActivation": "enabled",
      "workspaceActivation": "disabled",
      "effectiveActivation": "disabled",
      "activationSource": "workspace_override"
    }
  ]
}
```

`workspaceActivation` is `enabled`, `disabled`, or `null` for inheritance. `activationSource` is `default`, `workspace_override`, `legacy_path_rule`, or `cli_override`. `desiredGeneration` is the durable store generation; `appliedGeneration` is the latest generation the controller recorded as applied to that workspace runtime and can temporarily lag.

Install requires explicit consent and an initial activation:

```json
{
  "source": "@scope/demo",
  "consent": true,
  "activation": { "scope": "user" },
  "ref": "optional-git-ref",
  "autoUpdate": true,
  "allowPreRelease": false,
  "registry": "https://registry.npmjs.org"
}
```

For workspace-only initial activation use `{ "scope": "workspace", "workspaceId": "target-workspace-id" }`; the target must exist and be trusted. Daemon installs accept GitHub, Git, and npm sources. `ref` does not apply to npm, and `registry` applies only to npm. `ref`, `autoUpdate`, `allowPreRelease`, and `registry` are optional.

Global and workspace activation `PUT` requests use the same body:

```json
{ "state": "enabled" }
```

`state` is `enabled` or `disabled`. Update, uninstall, check-updates, clear-activation, and refresh requests have no required body.

Every accepted asynchronous mutation returns:

```http
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Location: /extensions/operations/<operation-id>
Retry-After: 1
Content-Type: application/json

{"accepted":true,"operationId":"<operation-id>"}
```

Workspace-qualified mutations use the same global `/extensions/operations/:operationId` polling path. Operation history is process-local, keeps only a bounded number of terminal entries, and is lost on daemon restart; clients must re-read the catalog or workspace projection and compare generations when an operation id disappears.

An operation snapshot has this shape:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "operationId": "<operation-id>",
  "operation": "install",
  "status": "running",
  "phase": "preparing",
  "createdAt": 1750000000000,
  "updatedAt": 1750000000100,
  "source": "owner/repository",
  "name": "demo"
}
```

`status` transitions from `queued` to `running`, then to `succeeded`, `succeeded_with_warnings`, or `failed`. While running, `phase` is `preparing`, `committing`, or `reconciling`. Terminal success may include `result` with `status` equal to `installed`, `enabled`, `disabled`, `updated`, `uninstalled`, `checked`, or `refreshed`; reconciliation results can additionally contain `refreshed`, `failed`, and `error`. Update checks return `result.states`, keyed by extension name, with values such as `checking for updates`, `update available`, `up to date`, `not updatable`, or `error`.

A durable commit followed by incomplete cleanup or runtime reconciliation is not reported as a failed mutation. It returns `succeeded_with_warnings` and preserves the committed result:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "operationId": "<operation-id>",
  "operation": "activation",
  "status": "succeeded_with_warnings",
  "createdAt": 1750000000000,
  "updatedAt": 1750000000200,
  "result": {
    "status": "disabled",
    "name": "demo",
    "refreshed": 1,
    "failed": 1
  },
  "warnings": [
    {
      "workspaceId": "workspace-id",
      "workspaceCwd": "/absolute/workspace",
      "code": "reconcile_slow",
      "error": "Runtime reconciliation took 31000ms."
    }
  ]
}
```

Warning `workspaceId` and `code` are optional; `workspaceCwd` and `error` are always present. Clients should display warnings, refresh their catalog/projection, and must not retry the durable mutation blindly.

Validation and authorization failures are synchronous HTTP errors using `{ "error": "...", "code": "..." }` when a stable code exists. Important cases are `400 invalid_extension_id`, `400 invalid_extension_activation`, `400 workspace_mismatch`, `403 untrusted_workspace`, `404 extension_operation_not_found`, and `429 extension_queue_full`. Install validation also returns `400` for invalid source/ref/registry options, missing consent, or missing/invalid initial activation. A mutation that fails after `202` is represented, while retained in operation history, with `status: "failed"`, `error`, and an optional stable `code`; common codes include `extension_prepare_timeout` and `extension_conflict`. HTTP `404` for an operation does not imply rollback because operation history is not durable.

`daemon_status` advertises `GET /daemon/status`, the consolidated read-only
operator diagnostic snapshot documented below.

**Conditional tags.** These feature tags are advertised only when their deployment toggle, runtime wiring, or availability condition is active. Tag presence means the documented behavior is available; absence means either an older daemon predating the tag or a current daemon where that condition is false. Currently:

Earlier permission/hook denials make no provider request. Nested AgentCore execution is outside v1 and is rejected while this external provider mode is active. The tag reflects only the external provider: independently of it, every daemon applies the built-in Git relocation guard to the managed tools that carry a shell command line (`run_shell_command` and `monitor`), so the absence of this tag does not mean no pre-execution denials. |

`mcp_guardrails` is **not** in this conditional table — it's an always-on tag, advertised whenever the binary supports the new `/workspace/mcp` budget fields, regardless of whether the operator configured a budget. Operators who haven't set `--mcp-client-budget` still get the new fields (with `budgetMode: 'off'`, `budgets: []`).

`mcp_guardrail_events` (issue [#4175](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/4175) PR 14b) advertises the typed SSE push events that surface MCP budget state crossings without a poll loop. Two frame types arrive on `GET /session/:id/events`:

- `mcp_budget_warning` — fires once on the upward 75% crossing of `reservedSlots.size / clientBudget`. Re-arms only after the ratio drops below 37.5% (`MCP_BUDGET_REARM_FRACTION`). Mirrors PR 10's `slow_client_warning` hysteresis, but at the manager level rather than the per-subscriber backlog level. Payload: `{ liveCount, reservedCount, budget, thresholdRatio: 0.75, mode: 'warn' | 'enforce' }`. Fires under both `warn` and `enforce` modes; never under `off`.
- `mcp_child_refused_batch` — fires at end of each `discoverAllMcpTools*` pass when one or more servers were refused, AND as a length-1 batch on the `readResource` lazy-spawn refusal path. Payload: `{ refusedServers: [{ name, transport, reason: 'budget_exhausted' }, ...], budget, liveCount, reservedCount, mode: 'enforce' }`. `mode` is the literal `'enforce'` because `warn` mode never refuses.

Both events live in the per-session SSE replay ring (they carry an `id`) so a client reconnecting with `Last-Event-ID` resumes through them; the snapshot at `GET /workspace/mcp` is still the source-of-truth for state-after-extended-disconnect. Always-on once advertised — there is no conditional toggle. SDK reducer state (`DaemonSessionViewState`) exposes `mcpBudgetWarningCount`, `lastMcpBudgetWarning`, `mcpChildRefusedBatchCount`, `lastMcpChildRefusedBatch` for adapters that want simple lag-style UI.

## Routes

Clients can feature-detect `session_turn_status` and poll `GET /session/:id/turns/current` or `GET /session/:id/turns/:promptId`. These routes require the live owning Session and never load or scan another workspace. Settled results are best-effort transcript records read from the active branch with a bounded scan; `prompt_not_found` means no result was found in the live queue, 64-entry terminal overlay, or bounded active window. `resultText` is the raw final parent-model answer after the last tool boundary, before optional message rewriting, and may be absent. Results over 32,768 UTF-16 code units include `resultTruncated: true` and `resultCode: "RESULT_TEXT_TRUNCATED"`.

### `GET /health`

Liveness probe. Default form returns `200 {"status":"ok"}` if the listener is up — cheap, no bridge access, suitable for high-frequency k8s/Compose liveness probes.

Pass `?deep=1` (also accepts `?deep=true` or bare `?deep`) for a daemon-wide probe that aggregates bridge **counters** across every managed workspace runtime, including a workspace that is still draining (informational only, not a true liveness check):

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "workspaceCount": 2,
  "sessions": 3,
  "pendingPermissions": 1,
  "activePrompts": 1,
  "activeWork": true,
  "activeWorkReporting": "full",
  "activeWorkStaleMs": 4200,
  "connectedClients": 2,
  "channelAlive": true,
  "lastActivityAt": "2026-07-15T08:30:00.000Z",
  "idleSinceMs": 120000
}
```

`sessions`, `pendingPermissions`, and `activePrompts` are sums. `activeWork` is true when any runtime has an accepted but unsettled prompt (including a FIFO-waiting prompt), a running background Agent, a queued/in-progress Agent terminal notification, or Session-managed background shell work. Shell work remains active while the shell registry reports a running entry and while its terminal notification is queued or driving the parent continuation; any number of shells contributes one bounded aggregate hold. Monitors, workflows, cron jobs, follow-up suggestions, and external processes the shell registry can no longer track remain outside the field. It is session-scoped: channel-level work with no session attached yet — a spawn in flight, a pending restore, MCP discovery or authentication — is not counted, so `activeWork` may read false while the daemon still declines to reclaim that channel. Do not read this field as "the daemon is reclaimable"; it describes session-owned work only. `activeWorkReporting` says how much of that boolean is actually vouched for: `full` when every live session is covered by a fresh report from a child that reports all required categories, `none` when no session negotiated reporting, and `partial` for anything between — including a stale snapshot or a negotiated child that omits a required category. A snapshot older than three report intervals stops counting as coverage: it is not a report that the session is idle, so the session goes back to reading as retained, exactly as if the child had never reported. Ordinary automatic cleanup is also disabled for a negotiated-but-incomplete child; a child that does not understand `shell` cannot safely authorize conditional close according to the complete current predicate. Completely unsupported historical children retain legacy cleanup behavior, and explicit close, kill, shutdown, and channel exit remain force operations. `activeWorkStaleMs` is the age of the oldest snapshot the boolean rests on **among the covered sessions**, and is `0` when no session is covered; it is diagnostic, because freshness is already graded into `activeWorkReporting` by the daemon (only the daemon knows each channel's negotiated cadence). The grade is computed once over every managed runtime rather than per runtime and then combined — a runtime with no sessions is vacuously complete, and treating that as evidence would let an empty workspace vouch for another workspace's unreported sessions. `lastActivityAt` is the latest non-null workspace activity time and `idleSinceMs` is derived from that same snapshot. `channelAlive` means at least one managed workspace channel is live; it does not mean every workspace is healthy. `connectedClients` and the optional `rateLimitHits` remain daemon-wide counters rather than per-workspace sums.

Restart controllers should treat the daemon as busy when:

```ts
const busy =
  health.activePrompts > 0 ||
  health.activeWork ||
  health.activeWorkReporting !== 'full';
```

Dropping the third term makes `activeWork === false` indistinguishable from "no child told me anything", which is the one case where acting on it is unsafe. Unknown responses and failed probes must also prevent restart. `activePrompts` remains an independent compatibility signal.

These fields are an observation cache, not a restart lease: even a fresh, fully-graded, empty answer describes the moment it was sampled, and work can start immediately afterwards. The rule above lowers the risk of a wrong restart substantially but does not eliminate it — strict safety needs a prepare-restart fence that stops new work admission, confirms the drain, and only then shuts down.

> ⚠️ The deep probe is **informational**, not a real liveness verification or an atomic reclaim lease. Negotiated ACP children publish channel-wide active-work snapshots on a negotiated cadence, and the daemon grades their freshness into `activeWorkReporting` — but it never kills a channel over a missing report, because one session's silence is not evidence the process died. Transport liveness and stalled-Agent detection are separate mechanisms. `connectedClients` counts REST SSE connections, not every ACP transport. Use repeated samples and graceful shutdown for idle reclamation; use authenticated `/daemon/status` for transport and per-workspace diagnostics. If any managed runtime getter throws, deep health fails closed with `503 {"status":"degraded","reason":"aggregation_failed"}` rather than returning partial totals, and the daemon log identifies the failing workspace runtime. During bootstrap, before the runtime registry is ready, it returns `503 {"status":"degraded","reason":"bootstrap"}` with `Retry-After: 1`. For listener liveness, use the default `/health` without `?deep`.

**Auth:** required **only on non-loopback binds**. On loopback (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `[::1]`) `/health` is registered before the bearer middleware so k8s/Compose probes inside the pod don't need to carry the token. On non-loopback (`--hostname 0.0.0.0` etc.) the route is registered after the bearer middleware and returns 401 without a valid token — otherwise an unauthenticated caller could probe arbitrary addresses to confirm a `qwen serve` exists, a low-severity info leak that combines poorly with port scanning. CORS deny + Host allowlist still apply on the loopback exemption.

### `GET /daemon/status`

Read-only operator diagnostics. Unlike `/health`, this is a normal daemon API:
it is registered after bearer auth and rate limiting, including on loopback
binds. Query parameter:

- `detail=summary` (default) reads only in-memory daemon state.
- `detail=full` also includes live session diagnostics, ACP connection
  diagnostics, auth device-flow counts, and workspace status sections.
- any other `detail` returns `400 { "code": "invalid_detail" }`.

`summary` intentionally does not query workspace status methods, start an ACP
child, or spawn a session. `full` queries each workspace section independently;
a timeout or exception marks only that section as `unavailable` and adds a
`workspace_status_unavailable` issue.

Multi-workspace responses also include top-level `workspaces[]` rows with
`{ id, cwd, displayName?, primary, trusted }`. The optional display name is
omitted when unset and remains presentation-only; status consumers must keep
using `id` or `cwd` to correlate runtimes.

`runtime.perf` is optional. When present, it reports daemon-process event loop
lag, prompt FIFO queue wait samples, and daemon-child pipe byte counters only;
ACP child event loop lag is not included in `/daemon/status`.

`status` is `error` if any issue has error severity, `warning` if any issue has
warning severity, otherwise `ok`. Issue codes are stable and include
`session_capacity_high`, `connection_capacity_high`, `pending_permissions`,
`acp_channel_down`, `preflight_error`, `mcp_budget_warning`,
`mcp_budget_exhausted`, `rate_limit_hits`, `channel_worker_exited`, and
`channel_worker_partial_connect`, and `workspace_status_unavailable`. During
the short window after the listener is ready but before the full runtime is
mounted, `/daemon/status` may report `daemon_runtime_starting`; if the async
runtime mount fails, it reports `daemon_runtime_failed` while non-status
runtime routes return `503`.

`runtime.activity` reports daemon-wide prompt activity. `activePrompts` counts sessions with an in-flight prompt. `pendingPrompts` counts all accepted prompts that have not settled yet, including the running prompt and FIFO-waiting prompts. `queuedPrompts` counts FIFO-waiting prompts that have been accepted but not dispatched. `lastActivityAt` is the ISO 8601 timestamp of the last prompt start/end or session spawn; `null` when the daemon has never processed any activity since boot. `idleSinceMs` is computed from `lastActivityAt` at response generation time.

`limits.memory` is additive and reports the daemon's resolved memory figures: a required `enforced: false`, a `childHeap` object (`mode`; `maxConcurrentChildren` and `perChildCeilingMb`, both `null` under `mode: 'off'`, which models nothing — and `perChildCeilingMb` additionally `null` wherever no partition can be modeled within `modeled.minChildHeapMb` — either the pool cannot cover one child at that floor, or the ceiling would land under it once capped at `modeled.legacyChildCeilingMb`, which is `floor(available / 2)` and so drops under the floor on a host below 1024 MB. It is never 0, and `maxConcurrentChildren` is `0` in those cases, since a host that models no partition is a computed answer rather than an absent model; and `refusals`, the spawns that would have exceeded the modeled limit), `configuredBudgetMb`, `effectiveBudgetMb` (the configured value capped at resolved cgroup/host memory), `budgetSource` (`flag` / `derived`), `availableMemoryMb`, `availableMemorySource` (`constrained` / `host`), `insufficientMemory`, and a `modeled` object holding `rootReserveMb`, `childPoolMb`, `minChildHeapMb`, `maxChildHeapMb`, and `legacyChildCeilingMb` (a conservative model of the ceiling an ACP child receives today, which can sit below the real figure). `runtime.memory` additionally reports `registeredWorkspaces` (the registration count — non-removed workspace entries, including draining, transitioning, or blocked ones; not a live-child count), `activeAcpChildren` (daemon-managed ACP children with a live, non-dying channel — includes transitioning or blocked entries, but excludes a workspace whose kill has started even if the child has not exited; not channel workers, MCP descendants, or unattached spawn reservations), `childRssCoverage` (`active_children` — every ACP child with a live channel, which is the set `activeAcpChildren` counts; older daemons send `primary_only`), a `children` object described below, and a `modeled` object holding `recommendedShareAtRegisteredMb` (`null` when no workspace is registered) and `recommendedShareAtActiveMb` (`null` when no child is active). Each share is capped at the legacy child ceiling, and floored at the minimum child heap only when the ceiling allows — on a small host the ceiling sits below the floor, so share × count can exceed the child pool. Read a share as advisory, not a partition of the pool. All of it is observation: no child spawn argument derives from these values, and no request is refused on their basis. `childHeap` models a fixed partition of `modeled.childPoolMb` — every child would receive the same `perChildCeilingMb`, so the modeled total stays inside the pool rather than accumulating as a per-spawn share would. Read `refusals` as admission pressure only: a count of 0 does **not** mean the partition is safe to apply, because children run on the much larger host-derived ceiling, so a workload needing more old space than `perChildCeilingMb` is healthy here and would only fail once the partition were applied. Two further reasons a nonzero count need not mean capacity pressure: the admission decision counts a terminating child until it exits, so on a daemon already at `maxConcurrentChildren` every channel replacement books a refusal during the overlap window; and on a host too small to model a partition `maxConcurrentChildren` is `0`, so `refusals` equals the total ACP spawn count, with `insufficientMemory` as the field that explains it. On the normal `runQwenServe` path the budget is resolved before the bootstrap app is created, so `limits.memory` is already populated during the bootstrap window. It is `null` only on paths that resolve no budget (such as direct-embed bypassing `runQwenServeImpl`). The SDK type allows `null`, so correct clients cope.

`runtime.memory.children` is additive within that block and reports aggregate RSS across the children `childRssCoverage` names: `rssBytes` (their summed self-reported RSS), `sampled` (how many produced a reading), and `oldestReadingAgeMs` (the age of the oldest reading in the sum, so a caller can tell how far apart its parts were taken). The denominator for `sampled` is the sibling `activeAcpChildren`, not repeated inside the block; when `sampled` is lower, `rssBytes` is a floor rather than a total. Sampling is gated on an active SSE/WS watcher, so a status request against a daemon nobody is streaming from reports `sampled: 0` even with live children — `activeAcpChildren` beside it makes that gap visible, and `rssBytes: 0` with `sampled: 0` never means a measured zero. `oldestReadingAgeMs` is `null` when nothing was sampled and also when every contributor is a bridge predating the field, so it never means "fresh". Read the sum as an over-count and an under-count at once: summing per-process RSS double-counts pages the children share, while each child reports only its own process, so its MCP descendants and every channel worker are missing. It is not the daemon tree's memory. The field is optional in the SDK mirror because daemons reporting `primary_only` never send it.

`runtime.memory.pressure` is additive within that block and reports the daemon root's own memory pressure: `mode` (`off` / `observe`), `level` (`normal` / `soft` / `hard` / `critical`), `source` (`rss` / `heap` / `unknown`), `ratio`, and the six raw figures the ratios come from — `rssBytes`, `rssRatio`, `availableBytes`, `heapUsedBytes`, `heapRatio`, `heapLimitBytes`. `ratio` is the larger of `rssRatio` and `heapRatio`, and `source` names which one it was; ties are reported as `rss`. `availableBytes` is `limits.memory.availableMemoryMb` in bytes — deliberately the detected cgroup/host figure rather than `effectiveBudgetMb`, because what ends the process is the real limit, not an operator's policy number. `source: "unknown"` means neither denominator was measurable and must not be read as healthy; `level` is `normal` in that case only because there is nothing to classify. The figures cover the daemon **root process only**: they are this process's own `memoryUsage()`, so children growing does not move them. `runtime.memory.children` reports those separately, and neither figure is process-tree memory. Both modes report the whole block; only `observe` additionally raises the path-free `daemon_memory_pressure` warning into the status rollup, so `off` leaves the top-level `status` unchanged. Nothing remediates in either mode. The field is optional in the SDK mirror because daemons that shipped `runtime.memory` before it exists send the block without it.

`limits.maxTotalSessions` is additive. `null` means the effective daemon-wide fresh-session cap is disabled. When several startup/restored workspaces are present, `--max-total-sessions` is omitted, and `maxSessionsPerWorkspace` is finite, the daemon derives the effective total cap once as `maxSessionsPerWorkspace * startupWorkspaceCount`; later dynamic registration does not recompute it. When set, it limits fresh session creation across the daemon and reports total-limit failures with the existing `session_limit_exceeded` error shape plus `scope: "total"`.

`runtime.channel.live` reports the ACP bridge channel inside the daemon. It is
not the channel-adapter worker. Daemon-managed channels use
`runtime.channelWorker`, whose `state` is one of `disabled`, `starting`,
`running`, `exited`, `failed`, or `stopped`. When a worker reaches `running`
and then exits, `/daemon/status` keeps the daemon online and reports warning
issue code `channel_worker_exited`.

Daemon-managed channel worker startup remains fail-fast: if `qwen serve
--channel ...` cannot start a worker that reaches ready, serve startup fails.
After a worker has reached ready, unexpected exits are restarted by the serve
supervisor within a bounded policy: up to 3 restart attempts in a 5 minute
window, with 1s, 5s, then 15s backoff. The worker sends IPC heartbeats every
15s; if no heartbeat is observed for 45s, the supervisor treats the worker as
stale, kills it, records `staleHeartbeatAt`, and uses the same restart path.

`runtime.channelWorker` may include additive operational fields:
`requestedChannels`, `pid`, `startedAt`, `exitCode`, `signal`, `error`,
`restartCount`, `lastExitAt`, `lastRestartAt`, `nextRestartAt`,
`lastHeartbeatAt`, `staleHeartbeatAt`, `startupFailures`, and
`startupFailuresTruncated`. Each startup failure has `channel`, `phase`
(currently `connect`), optional adapter-provided `code`, and a credential-
redacted `message`. At most 64 failures are retained for the current worker
generation; the truncation flag means more failures were observed. `code` is
diagnostic and is not a stable cross-adapter classification. `restartCount` is the lifetime
number of restart attempts made by this serve process; a running worker with
`restartCount > 0` is healthy unless another issue applies. A running worker
whose `requestedChannels` include names missing from `channels` reports
`channel_worker_partial_connect`.

On a multi-workspace daemon (`--workspace` repeated), `runtime` additionally
includes `channelWorkers[]` — one entry per owning workspace, each a
`channelWorker` snapshot annotated with `workspaceId`, `workspaceCwd`, and
`primary`. `channelWorker` stays populated as the primary workspace's snapshot
for compatibility. Single-workspace daemons omit `channelWorkers[]`.

### Daemon-managed channel control

The `channel_control` capability advertises the runtime selection resource.
The resource is daemon-wide even though its compatibility path uses the
singular `/workspace` prefix. Runtime selections are not persisted and do not
modify the daemon's boot-time `--channel` option.

`GET /workspace/channel` returns an immutable manager snapshot:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "selection": { "mode": "names", "names": ["telegram", "feishu"] },
  "pendingSelection": { "mode": "names", "names": ["telegram"] },
  "transition": "reconciling",
  "workers": [
    {
      "workspaceId": "primary-id",
      "workspaceCwd": "/work/primary",
      "primary": true,
      "enabled": true,
      "state": "running",
      "channels": ["telegram"],
      "pid": 1234
    }
  ]
}
```

`selection` is `null` while disabled. `pendingSelection` is present only during
a mutation. `transition` is one of `idle`, `starting`, `reconciling`,
`stopping`, or `rolling_back`.

`PUT /workspace/channel` is strict-gated and accepts exactly one selection:

```json
{ "selection": { "mode": "all" } }
```

```json
{ "selection": { "mode": "names", "names": ["telegram", "feishu"] } }
```

Names are trimmed and deduplicated without sorting; an empty names array is
invalid. `all` remains primary-workspace-only. A disabled-to-enabled change
returns `201`; an idempotent PUT or replacement returns `200`. The response is
`{ changed, replaced, partial, state }`. An equal selection keeps healthy
workers in place, but recovers an equal selection whose worker is stopped or
failed.

`DELETE /workspace/channel` is strict-gated and idempotent. It returns
`{ changed, state }`; a successful state is disabled. `POST
/workspace/channel/reload` is also strict-gated and re-reads settings,
re-resolves workspace groups, and force-reconciles the committed selection.
It returns `409 channel_worker_not_enabled` while disabled. The
`channel_reload` capability is advertised dynamically only while the manager
has a committed, reloadable selection.

Every enable, replace, reload, stop, and daemon shutdown enters one FIFO
lifecycle lane. GET does not wait for that lane. Workspace groups whose ordered
selection did not change remain online. Replacement failures attempt to stop
newly started workers and restore the previous committed selection. Clients
must inspect `rolledBack`, `rollbackError`, and `state` because cleanup or
restoration can also fail. The daemon keeps the channel-service PID lease
throughout a transaction and does not release it until every relevant child
exit is confirmed.

Stable control errors are:

- `400 invalid_channel_selection`, `channel_workspace_mismatch`, or `ambiguous_channel_workspace`
- `403 untrusted_workspace`
- `409 channel_service_conflict` or `channel_worker_not_enabled`
- `500 channel_worker_stop_failed`
- `502 channel_worker_start_failed`, with `rolledBack` and an optional credential-redacted `rollbackError`
- `503 daemon_draining`

Strict writes against a daemon without a configured token return `401
token_required` before control code runs. Once a request begins, disconnecting
the HTTP client does not cancel the lifecycle transaction; clients may retry
the same PUT safely.

For `502 channel_worker_start_failed`, the response may also include
`startupFailures[]` and `startupFailuresTruncated`. Each failure adds the
trusted `workspaceCwd` of the attempted worker. These fields describe the
failed transaction, while `state` describes the current state after rollback;
a later GET does not retain the failed attempt. A partially connected worker
instead returns success and exposes its failures in the worker snapshot. Boot-
time all-failure still aborts `qwen serve` before a queryable daemon exists.

`qwen channel status` without `--daemon-url` continues to read pidfile metadata;
with `--daemon-url` it reads `GET /workspace/channel`. During a restart
window the serve-owned pidfile remains reserved, but `workerPid` is omitted so
clients do not display a stale worker process. On a multi-workspace daemon the
pidfile also carries an additive `workers[]` array (per-workspace
`workspaceId` / `workspaceCwd` / `channels` / live `workerPid`) while the
top-level `channels` (union) and `workerPid` (primary) stay populated for older
readers; single-workspace daemons keep the original single-worker shape. Worker
stdout/stderr are forwarded into the daemon log with bearer tokens, sensitive
worker environment values, and proxy URL credentials redacted.

### Workspace Channel management

The `channel_management` capability advertises workspace-scoped Channel
configuration and runtime management. The singular `/workspace` routes target
the primary runtime. `/workspaces/:workspace` resolves the exact registered,
trusted runtime and never falls back to the primary runtime.

Read-only discovery uses:

- `GET /workspace/channel-types`
- `GET /workspace/channels`
- `GET /workspaces/:workspace/channel-types`
- `GET /workspaces/:workspace/channels`

The catalog marks the types supported by this management API with
`manageable: true`. Instance snapshots include a revision, redacted secret
presence metadata, startup state, and runtime state; literal secrets are never
returned. Channel snapshots use `Cache-Control: no-store`.

Field descriptors can expose nested object metadata through `properties`.
Numeric descriptors can use `exclusiveMinimum` for open lower bounds. Clients
that do not render an advertised field kind must preserve its existing config
value instead of coercing or deleting it. Object fields cannot be required,
and nested properties cannot be secrets or environment-resolvable fields;
those management protocols remain top-level only. A nested `required` property
is enforced only while its parent object is present in the write; omitting the
parent object leaves its nested requirements unchecked. Writes replace each
field's stored value wholesale, so preserving an object means resending the
stored object; the daemon does not merge partial objects.

Configuration writes use optimistic concurrency and the strict bearer-token
gate:

- `PUT /workspace/channels/:name`
- `DELETE /workspace/channels/:name`
- `PUT /workspace/channels/:name/startup`
- the equivalent `/workspaces/:workspace/...` routes

Each settings mutation includes `expectedRevision`. Upsert requests contain a
`config` object and may contain explicit secret operations: `preserve`,
`replace`, or `clear`. A Channel config cannot select a working directory
outside the resolved workspace.

Runtime actions are strict-gated `POST` requests to
`.../channels/:name/start`, `stop`, or `restart`. They operate only on the
worker owned by the resolved workspace.

Pairing management is available only for instances configured with the
`pairing` sender policy or group policy:

- `GET .../channels/:name/pairing-requests`
- `POST .../channels/:name/pairing-requests/approve` with `{ "code": "..." }`
- `GET .../channels/:name/pairing-approvals`
- `DELETE .../channels/:name/pairing-approvals` with
  either `{ "senderId": "..." }` or `{ "groupId": "..." }`

All pairing routes require a bearer token and use `Cache-Control: no-store`.
Requests, approvals, and revocations are scoped to the selected Channel
instance and workspace. Pending requests include a typed user or group subject;
group requests also retain the sender who initiated the request. Approval
snapshots contain `senderIds` and `groupIds` because allowlists do not persist
display names. Revoking an unknown user or group returns
`404 channel_pairing_approval_not_found`.

### Channel delivery and Notify

`channel_delivery` advertises immediate, best-effort delivery support. It is a
protocol capability, not a worker health signal. Delivery never starts a
missing worker, falls back to another workspace, retries, persists an outbox,
or replays historical notifications.

Direct Notify bypasses Agent and Session and waits for one send attempt:

```http
POST /workspace/notify
POST /workspaces/:workspace/notify
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "text": "service unavailable",
  "delivery": {
    "kind": "channel",
    "target": {
      "channelName": "dingtalk",
      "type": "user",
      "id": "platform-user-id"
    }
  }
}
```

Both routes use the strict mutation gate. The qualified route resolves only a
registered, trusted workspace. Success is `200 {delivered:true,deliveryId}`.
`delivered:true` means the Channel send Promise resolved; it does not prove
provider acceptance, user receipt, or a read receipt. Provider-specific
response validation and consistent error-reason semantics across IM adapters
are outside this V1 contract.
Errors are `400 channel_delivery_invalid`, `503 channel_worker_unavailable` or
`channel_delivery_queue_full`, `504 channel_delivery_timeout`, and `502
channel_delivery_rejected` or `channel_delivery_failed`. A timeout has an
unknown outcome and is not retried.
There is intentionally no separate connectivity-test endpoint: a normal
Notify call is the end-to-end test.

The replayable result event contains only correlation and sanitized status:

```json
{
  "type": "channel_delivery_result",
  "promptId": "prompt-1",
  "data": {
    "sessionId": "session-1",
    "deliveryId": "prompt-1",
    "source": "prompt",
    "status": "failed",
    "promptId": "prompt-1",
    "code": "channel_worker_unavailable",
    "error": "Channel worker is not running."
  }
}
```

An empty successful Prompt final omits error fields:

```json
{
  "type": "channel_delivery_result",
  "promptId": "prompt-1",
  "data": {
    "sessionId": "session-1",
    "deliveryId": "prompt-1",
    "source": "prompt",
    "status": "skipped",
    "promptId": "prompt-1"
  }
}
```

`source` is `prompt` or `scheduled`; `status` is `delivered`, `failed`, or
`skipped`. `skipped` means the eligible turn completed successfully but its
last tool-free assistant response block was empty or whitespace-only. The
daemon consumes the delivery authorization and publishes the event without
resolving a Channel Worker. Scheduled correlation uses `taskId` and `firedAt`.
The event never contains target IDs, message text, credentials, or webhook
secrets.

Security: the response never includes bearer tokens, client ids, full ACP
connection ids, device-flow user codes, or verification URLs. Both detail
levels may include additive `daemon.runId`, `daemon.logMode`, and
`daemon.logHealth`. `summary` omits the daemon log path and loss details;
`full` may include `logPath`, `logIssues`, `logDroppedRecords`, and
`logDroppedBytes` for authenticated operators. Degraded file logging adds the
path-free `daemon_log_degraded` warning to the normal status rollup.

### `GET /capabilities`

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "protocolVersions": {
    "current": "v1",
    "supported": ["v1"]
  },
  "mode": "http-bridge",
  "features": [
    "health",
    "daemon_status",
    "capabilities",
    "multi_workspace_sessions",
    "..."
  ],
  "limits": {
    "maxPendingPromptsPerSession": 5,
    "maxSessionsPerWorkspace": 32,
    "maxTotalSessions": 64,
    "sessionRestoreTimeoutMs": 60000
  },
  "modelServices": [],
  "workspaceCwd": "/canonical/path/to/primary-workspace",
  "workspaces": [
    {
      "id": "stable-workspace-id",
      "cwd": "/canonical/path/to/primary-workspace",
      "primary": true,
      "trusted": true
    },
    {
      "id": "stable-secondary-workspace-id",
      "cwd": "/canonical/path/to/secondary-workspace",
      "displayName": "Payments Production",
      "primary": false,
      "trusted": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Stable contract: when `v` increments the frame layout has changed in a backwards-incompatible way.

> **`protocolVersions`** describes the serve protocol versions the daemon can speak. `current` is the daemon's preferred protocol version and `supported` is the compatible set. Clients that require a specific protocol should check `supported`; feature-specific UI should still gate on `features`. Additive to v=1: older v=1 daemons omit this field, so SDK clients that target older builds should treat it as optional.

> **`modelServices` is always `[]` in Stage 1.** The agent uses its single default model service and doesn't enumerate it over the wire. Stage 2 will populate this from registered model adapters so SDK clients can build service-pickers; until then, do NOT rely on this field being non-empty.

> **`workspaceCwd`** is the canonical absolute path for the daemon's primary workspace. Use it to omit `cwd` on `POST /session` (the route falls back to this primary path) and to keep old single-workspace clients compatible. Additive to v=1: pre-§02 v=1 daemons omit the field — clients that target older builds should null-check before consuming it.

> **`workspaces[]`** lists every registered runtime. Newer single-workspace daemons include the primary runtime even when `multi_workspace_sessions` is absent so clients can discover the stable id required by workspace-qualified routes; older daemons may omit the array. Each entry is `{ id, cwd, displayName?, primary, trusted, removable? }`. `displayName` is presentation-only and omitted when unset. The first/primary workspace remains mirrored by `workspaceCwd`; new clients choose a non-primary runtime by passing that entry's `cwd` to `POST /session`. Untrusted workspaces are advertised for diagnostics but reject fresh session creation with `403 untrusted_workspace` until trust changes. `removable` is present on daemons that support runtime removal and is true only for process-dynamic or persistence-restored secondary runtimes.

The workspace feature tags and `workspaces[]` are dynamic. Clients that add a workspace must fetch `/capabilities` again after the mutation completes; the daemon does not broadcast capability changes to clients that cached an earlier response. Forgetting persistence does not unload an active runtime, so that runtime remains advertised until restart.

### `POST /workspaces`

Register an additional workspace runtime. The path must be an existing, accessible, absolute directory that does not duplicate or nest with another registered workspace. Registration is process-local unless the client sends `persist: true`; clients must pre-flight `persistent_workspace_registration` before requesting persistence. When `workspace_display_name` is advertised, the request may also include an optional `displayName`.

```json
{
  "cwd": "/canonical/path/to/secondary-workspace",
  "persist": true,
  "displayName": "Payments Production"
}
```

A newly created runtime returns `201`; promoting an already-active secondary workspace to persistent returns `200`. Persistent success includes `persisted: true`:

```json
{
  "id": "stable-workspace-id",
  "cwd": "/canonical/path/to/secondary-workspace",
  "displayName": "Payments Production",
  "primary": false,
  "trusted": true,
  "persisted": true
}
```

`displayName` must be a string no longer than 256 characters after surrounding whitespace is trimmed. An empty result is treated as no name, and internal C0 (`U+0000`–`U+001F`) or DEL (`U+007F`) control characters are rejected. JSON `null` is not a creation value and returns `400 invalid_display_name`; omit the field to supply no initial name. Duplicate display names are allowed. A name supplied with a process-local registration lasts only for that daemon process; `persist: true` stores it with the persistent registration so it can be restored after restart. Repeating the request for an already-persistent workspace is idempotent and does not rename it.

Errors include `400 invalid_path` / `invalid_persist_flag` / `invalid_persist_target` / `invalid_display_name`, `409 workspace_exists` / `workspace_nested` / `workspace_limit_reached`, `500 workspace_registration_store_error` / `runtime_creation_failed`, and `501 persistence_not_available` / `not_implemented`.

### `PATCH /workspaces/:workspace`

Update an active workspace resource selected by workspace ID or URL-encoded absolute cwd. The endpoint currently supports only display-name metadata:

```json
{ "displayName": "Payments Production" }
```

Send `{ "displayName": null }` to clear the name. Here `null` is an update-only deletion sentinel; non-null values follow the same string normalization rules as `POST /workspaces`. The response is the updated `{ id, cwd, displayName?, primary, trusted, removable? }` workspace projection. Runtime metadata is always updated. If the runtime has matching persistent registration identities, every alias is updated atomically through the existing schema-v1 registration store; the endpoint never creates or promotes a persistent registration.

Unsupported fields fail closed rather than being silently ignored. Errors include `400 empty_patch` / `invalid_display_name` / `unsupported_field` / `workspace_mismatch`, `409 workspace_registration_in_progress`, `500 workspace_registration_store_error`, and `503 daemon_shutting_down`.

### `DELETE /workspaces/:workspace`

Remove one removable secondary runtime. The selector follows the plural workspace routing rules and accepts either a workspace ID or a URL-encoded absolute cwd. The optional JSON body is `{ "force": boolean }`; omitting it requests non-force removal.

Non-force removal returns `409 workspace_busy` with an `activity` snapshot when the frozen runtime has sessions, prompts, pending starts, ACP connections, memory tasks, or workspace channel workers. Sending `{ "force": true }` requests termination of those resources. Persistence removal is the commit point: subsequent cleanup is bounded and best-effort, cleanup failures are logged, and logical removal still converges instead of restoring the runtime. A successful response is:

```json
{
  "removed": true,
  "workspaceId": "stable-workspace-id",
  "workspaceCwd": "/canonical/path/to/secondary-workspace",
  "forced": true,
  "persistedRegistrationRemoved": true,
  "activity": {
    "sessions": 2,
    "activePrompts": 1,
    "pendingSessionStarts": 0,
    "acpConnections": 1,
    "memoryTasks": 0,
    "channelWorkers": 0,
    "voiceSessions": 0
  }
}
```

An immediately busy non-force request returns a fast pre-drain activity snapshot. Once drain starts, the busy or success response contains the final snapshot taken after admission and ACP drain gates close and before cleanup begins. Errors include `400 invalid_force_flag` / `workspace_mismatch`, `409 workspace_busy` / `primary_workspace_removal_forbidden` / `static_workspace_removal_forbidden` / `workspace_removal_in_progress` / `workspace_registration_in_progress`, `500 workspace_persist_failed` / `workspace_runtime_removal_failed`, `501 workspace_runtime_removal_unsupported`, and `503 daemon_shutting_down`.

### `GET /workspace-registrations`

List the persisted desired workspace set for this primary workspace. Entries remain visible with `active: false` when a stored directory could not be restored during the current start.
An entry remains `active: true` while its runtime is draining because the runtime still owns live resources until removal completes.
Entries include optional `displayName` when the persistent registration has one.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "primaryWorkspace": "/canonical/path/to/primary-workspace",
  "entries": [
    {
      "id": "stable-registration-id",
      "cwd": "/canonical/path/to/secondary-workspace",
      "displayName": "Payments Production",
      "active": true,
      "persisted": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Returns `501 persistence_not_available` when no registration store is configured and `500 workspace_registration_store_error` when the store cannot be read.

### `DELETE /workspace-registrations/:id`

Forget one persisted registration. This does not unload an active runtime or terminate its sessions; `restartRequired: true` means the active runtime disappears on the next daemon restart.

```json
{ "removed": true, "active": true, "restartRequired": true }
```

Returns `404 workspace_registration_not_found`, `500 workspace_registration_store_error`, or `501 persistence_not_available`. Like other mutation routes, this endpoint requires mutation authentication when daemon authentication is enabled.

### Read-only runtime status routes

These routes report daemon-side runtime snapshots. They are additive v1 routes,
do not mutate state, and do not change the serve protocol version. Workspace
status routes intentionally do **not** start the ACP child process just because
a client polls a GET route: if the daemon is idle, they return
`initialized: false` with an empty snapshot. Session status routes require a
live session and return `404 { code: "session_not_found", ... }` for unknown
ids.

`workspace_acp_status` reports the primary workspace ACP channel's
point-in-time liveness as `{ channelLive: boolean }`. The handler does not
create a channel, but reaching a runtime route can first start a deferred daemon
runtime, whose configured startup policy may independently preheat ACP. The
snapshot is not a lease: clients must let Session creation revalidate or start
the channel.

### ACP preheat

Capability tag: `workspace_acp_preheat`.

`POST /workspace/acp/preheat?timeoutMs=N` best-effort initializes the primary
workspace ACP channel. `timeoutMs` defaults to 5000 and must be a positive
integer no greater than 60000. Concurrent callers and Session creation share
the same bridge initialization. A request timeout ends only that HTTP wait; it
does not cancel the shared initialization.

```ts
interface WorkspaceAcpPreheatResult {
  ready: boolean;
  channelLive: boolean;
  durationMs: number;
  reason?: 'timeout' | 'error';
  error?: string;
}
```

`ready` always equals `channelLive`. A live response omits `reason` and
`error`; otherwise `reason` is `timeout` or `error`. `durationMs` measures the
current HTTP call, not the full lifetime of an initialization the call joined.
Operational timeout or failure returns HTTP 200. Invalid `timeoutMs` returns
400, while authentication, rate limiting, and deferred-runtime failures retain
their normal responses.

Both ACP workspace routes are singular and primary-workspace-only. Clients
must not use them for a secondary workspace or interpret either response as a
durable readiness guarantee.

Common status cell:

```ts
type DaemonStatus =
  | 'ok'
  | 'warning'
  | 'error'
  | 'disabled'
  | 'not_started'
  | 'unknown';

type DaemonErrorKind =
  | 'missing_binary'
  | 'blocked_egress'
  | 'auth_env_error'
  | 'init_timeout'
  | 'restore_timeout'
  | 'protocol_error'
  | 'missing_file'
  | 'parse_error';

interface DaemonStatusCell {
  kind: string;
  status: DaemonStatus;
  error?: string;
  errorKind?: DaemonErrorKind;
  hint?: string;
}
```

`errorKind` is a closed enum shared by `/workspace/preflight`,
`/workspace/env`, and (eventually) MCP guardrails so SDK clients can render
remediation per category instead of parsing free-form messages. The original
seven status literals came from #4175; `restore_timeout` was added separately
for session restore requests. `blocked_egress` remains reserved until the
egress probe lands.

Status payloads never expose MCP env values, headers, OAuth/service-account
details, provider API keys, provider `baseUrl` / `envKey`, skill body, skill
filesystem paths, hook definitions, or values of secret environment
variables. `/workspace/env` reports the **presence** of whitelisted env
vars only; proxy URLs are stripped of credentials and reduced to
`host:port` before they hit the wire.

### `GET /workspace/mcp`

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "workspaceCwd": "/canonical/path",
  "initialized": true,
  "discoveryState": "completed",
  "servers": [
    {
      "kind": "mcp_server",
      "status": "ok",
      "name": "docs",
      "mcpStatus": "connected",
      "transport": "stdio",
      "disabled": false,
      "description": "Documentation server",
      "extensionName": "docs-ext"
    }
  ]
}
```

`discoveryState` is one of `not_started`, `in_progress`, or `completed`.
`transport` is one of `stdio`, `sse`, `http`, `websocket`, `sdk`, or
`unknown`. `errors` is omitted when discovery succeeds.

**MCP client guardrails (issue [#4175](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/4175)).** Current daemons extend the payload with four additive fields and a capability-scoped budget cell:

```jsonc
{
  "v": 1,
  "workspaceCwd": "/canonical/path",
  "initialized": true,
  "discoveryState": "completed",
  "clientCount": 3,
  "clientBudget": 2,
  "budgetMode": "enforce",
  "budgets": [
    {
      "kind": "mcp_budget",
      "scope": "workspace",
      "status": "error",
      "errorKind": "budget_exhausted",
      "hint": "Raise --mcp-client-budget or remove servers from mcpServers config.",
      "liveCount": 2,
      "budget": 2,
      "mode": "enforce",
      "refusedCount": 1,
    },
  ],
  "servers": [
    {
      "kind": "mcp_server",
      "status": "ok",
      "name": "a",
      "mcpStatus": "connected",
      "transport": "stdio",
      "disabled": false,
    },
    {
      "kind": "mcp_server",
      "status": "ok",
      "name": "b",
      "mcpStatus": "connected",
      "transport": "stdio",
      "disabled": false,
    },
    {
      "kind": "mcp_server",
      "status": "error",
      "name": "c",
      "mcpStatus": "disconnected",
      "transport": "stdio",
      "disabled": false,
      "disabledReason": "budget",
      "errorKind": "budget_exhausted",
      "hint": "...",
    },
  ],
}
```

`budgetMode` is one of `enforce`, `warn`, or `off`. `clientBudget` is absent when no budget was set. `budgets[]` is **always an array** on daemons advertising `mcp_guardrails` (possibly empty when `budgetMode === 'off'`); older daemons omit the field entirely. When `mcp_workspace_pool` is advertised, the cell has `scope: 'workspace'` and covers the selected workspace runtime's shared pool. When that tag is absent, including under `QWEN_SERVE_NO_MCP_POOL=1`, the legacy manager emits `scope: 'session'`. Consumers MUST tolerate additional unrecognized scope values.

`disabledReason` on per-server cells distinguishes operator-disabled (`'config'` — `disabledMcpServers` config list) from budget-refused (`'budget'` — discovered but never connected due to `enforce` mode). Refusals are deterministic by `Object.entries(mcpServers)` declaration order. The per-server `status: 'error', errorKind: 'budget_exhausted'` shadows the raw `mcpStatus: 'disconnected'` (which is true but not the operator-facing severity).

Budget enforcement is capability-driven. With `mcp_workspace_pool`, sessions inside one workspace runtime share transports and one `WorkspaceMcpBudget`; different workspace runtimes never share a pool or budget. Without the tag, each ACP session's `McpClientManager` enforces its own copy of the cap and the snapshot represents that legacy session view.

**Detecting budget pressure.** Two surfaces, both populated post-PR-14b:

- **Push events** (advertised via `mcp_guardrail_events`): subscribe to `GET /session/:id/events` and narrow `mcp_budget_warning` / `mcp_child_refused_batch` frames through `KnownDaemonEvent`. The state machine fires once per upward 75% crossing (re-armed below 37.5%); refusals are coalesced once per discovery pass under `enforce` mode.
- **Snapshot poll** (advertised via `mcp_guardrails`): `GET /workspace/mcp` and inspect the budget cell (`budgets[0]`) together with `mcp_workspace_pool` to determine its scope:

- `budgets[0].status === 'warning'` ⇔ `liveCount >= 0.75 * clientBudget` (matches the hysteresis threshold PR 14b's push event will use).
- `budgets[0].status === 'error'` ⇔ `refusedCount > 0` (one or more servers refused this discovery pass).
- `budgets[0].status === 'ok'` ⇔ below the 75% threshold AND no refusals.

Recommended poll cadence: aligned with whatever already polls `/workspace/mcp`; the snapshot is cheap and the budget cell carries no extra discovery cost. SDK clients that subscribe to push events still benefit from the snapshot for state-after-extended-disconnect (the SSE replay ring depth is finite — `--event-ring-size`, default 8000 — so a client offline longer than the ring's coverage falls back to snapshot resync).

### `GET /workspace/skills`

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "workspaceCwd": "/canonical/path",
  "initialized": true,
  "skills": [
    {
      "kind": "skill",
      "status": "ok",
      "name": "review",
      "description": "Review code",
      "level": "project",
      "modelInvocable": true,
      "userInvocable": false,
      "installedPath": "/home/alice/project/.qwen/skills/review/SKILL.md",
      "argumentHint": "[path]"
    }
  ]
}
```

`level` is one of `project`, `user`, `extension`, or `bundled`.
`userInvocable` (boolean, optional) is omitted for normal skills (meaning
`true`) and is present only as `false` when the skill cannot be invoked manually
or toggled through the skill API. `modelInvocable` is independent: `false`
means the skill remains manually available but is hidden from model invocation.
`installedPath` is the existing absolute path to the skill's `SKILL.md`; the
daemon returns it as stored without separately resolving symlinks or
canonicalizing it. Current daemons emit it for every skill, while clients must
tolerate its absence from older v1 daemons. Skill bodies, hooks, `skillRoot`,
and other skill configuration remain excluded. `errors` is omitted when
discovery succeeds.

Repeated reads are served from the last committed workspace snapshot,
periodically revalidated against the child's in-memory cache. A read never
scans skill directories or reparses `SKILL.md` files. The child does verify
that its extension sources are unchanged — one `readdir` of the extensions
directory plus a `stat` per entry, the enablement file, and the store's
activation state — and refreshes only when they moved, so an extension
installed or toggled outside the daemon is still picked up on the next read.
Safe and bare mode skip the check, matching their exclusion of extensions.

### `GET /workspace/providers`

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "workspaceCwd": "/canonical/path",
  "initialized": true,
  "current": { "authType": "qwen", "modelId": "qwen3(qwen)" },
  "providers": [
    {
      "kind": "model_provider",
      "status": "ok",
      "authType": "qwen",
      "current": true,
      "models": [
        {
          "modelId": "qwen3(qwen)",
          "baseModelId": "qwen3",
          "name": "Qwen 3",
          "description": null,
          "contextLimit": 4096,
          "isCurrent": true,
          "isRuntime": false
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Models are grouped by auth type. Provider connection diagnostics live on
`/workspace/preflight`'s `providers` cell; environment preflight lives on
`/workspace/preflight` and `/workspace/env` (below). `errors` is omitted
when snapshot construction succeeds.

### `GET /workspace/env`

Reports the daemon process's runtime, platform, sandbox, proxy, and the
**presence** of whitelisted secret environment variables. Always answers
from `process.*` state — the daemon never spawns an ACP child to serve
this route, and the response is identical whether ACP is up or idle. The
`acpChannelLive` field is informational only.

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "workspaceCwd": "/canonical/path",
  "initialized": true,
  "acpChannelLive": false,
  "cells": [
    { "kind": "runtime", "name": "node", "status": "ok", "value": "22.4.0" },
    { "kind": "platform", "name": "darwin", "status": "ok", "value": "arm64" },
    {
      "kind": "sandbox",
      "name": "SANDBOX",
      "status": "disabled",
      "present": false
    },
    {
      "kind": "proxy",
      "name": "HTTPS_PROXY",
      "status": "ok",
      "present": true,
      "value": "proxy.internal:1080"
    },
    {
      "kind": "proxy",
      "name": "NO_PROXY",
      "status": "disabled",
      "present": false
    },
    {
      "kind": "env_var",
      "name": "OPENAI_API_KEY",
      "status": "ok",
      "present": true
    },
    {
      "kind": "env_var",
      "name": "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL",
      "status": "disabled",
      "present": false
    }
  ]
}
```

Cell shape:

```ts
type DaemonEnvKind =
  | 'runtime' // name: 'node' | 'bun' | 'unknown'; value: process.versions.node
  | 'platform' // name: process.platform; value: process.arch
  | 'sandbox' // name: 'SANDBOX' | 'SEATBELT_PROFILE'; value optional
  | 'proxy' // name: HTTP_PROXY | HTTPS_PROXY | NO_PROXY | ALL_PROXY; value: redacted host
  | 'env_var'; // presence-only; value field is ALWAYS omitted

interface DaemonEnvCell extends DaemonStatusCell {
  kind: DaemonEnvKind;
  name: string;
  present?: boolean;
  value?: string;
}
```

**Redaction policy.** `kind: 'env_var'` cells never include a `value`
field; clients see `present: boolean` only. `kind: 'proxy'` cells run the
raw env value through credential redaction (`redactProxyCredentials`) and
then through `URL` parsing so the wire only carries `host:port`. `NO_PROXY`
is passed through redaction verbatim because it is a host list rather than
a URL. The whitelist of enumerated secret env vars currently includes
`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`,
`DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, and `QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN`. Other
env vars are not enumerated, so accidentally-set secrets stay invisible.

### `GET /workspace/preflight`

Reports daemon readiness checks. **Daemon-level cells** (`node_version`,
`cli_entry`, `workspace_dir`, `ripgrep`, `git`, `npm`) are always
populated from `process.*` and `node:fs`. **ACP-level cells** (`auth`,
`mcp_discovery`, `skills`, `providers`, `tool_registry`, `egress`)
require a live ACP child — when the daemon is idle they emit
`status: 'not_started'` placeholders. The route never spawns ACP solely
to populate cells; the corresponding cells fall back to `not_started`.

Idle response (no ACP child):

```json
{
  "v": 1,

Cell shape:

```ts
type DaemonPreflightKind =
  | 'node_version'
  | 'cli_entry'
  | 'workspace_dir'
  | 'ripgrep'
  | 'git'
  | 'npm'
  | 'auth'
  | 'mcp_discovery'
  | 'skills'
  | 'providers'
  | 'tool_registry'
  | 'egress';

interface DaemonPreflightCell extends DaemonStatusCell {
  kind: DaemonPreflightKind;
  locality: 'daemon' | 'acp';
  detail?: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

`errorKind` semantics:

- `missing_binary` — Node version below required, missing `QWEN_CLI_ENTRY`,
  ripgrep / git / npm not on PATH (warnings rather than errors for the
  optional binaries).
- `missing_file` — `boundWorkspace` does not exist or is not a directory;
  skill parse error pointing at a missing or unreadable file.
- `parse_error` — `SKILL.md` parse failure, malformed config JSON.
- `auth_env_error` — `validateAuthMethod` returned a non-null failure
  string, or a `ModelConfigError` subclass propagated from provider
  resolution.
- `init_timeout` — `withTimeout` reject in the bridge (an actual timeout
  while waiting on an ACP roundtrip). Recognized via the
  `BridgeTimeoutError` typed class. Note: a transient `mcp_discovery`
  `warning` cell with `connecting > 0` does NOT carry this kind — that's
  a normal handshake-in-progress state, distinct from a real timeout.
- `restore_timeout` — a session load or resume exceeded the dedicated restore
  budget. The REST response is `504` and is retryable; it is distinct from
  child initialization and from the bounded replay-window limits.
- `protocol_error` — ACP `extMethod` rejected because the channel closed
  mid-request, or because tool registry was unexpectedly absent.
- `blocked_egress` — reserved for PR 14 (#4175). PR 13 leaves the
  `egress` cell as `status: 'not_started'`.

If the bridge fails to reach the ACP child while serving a preflight
request (e.g. a mid-request channel close), the envelope's `errors` array
carries a single `ServeStatusCell` describing the failure and the cells
fall back to `not_started` ACP placeholders. Daemon-level cells are still
returned.

### Workspace file routes

All file paths are resolved through the daemon's primary workspace. Responses use
workspace-relative paths and never return absolute filesystem paths for normal
success cases. Successful file responses include:

```http
Cache-Control: no-store
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
```

Filesystem errors use this JSON shape:

```json
{
  "errorKind": "hash_mismatch",
  "error": "expected sha256:..., found sha256:...",
  "hint": "re-read the file and retry with the latest hash",
  "status": 409
}
```

`errorKind` values include `path_outside_workspace`, `symlink_escape`,
`path_not_found`, `binary_file`, `file_too_large`, `untrusted_workspace`,
`permission_denied`, `parse_error`, `hash_mismatch`,
`file_already_exists`, `text_not_found`, and `ambiguous_text_match`.

#### `GET /file`

Reads a text file. Query params: `path` (required), `maxBytes`, `line`, `limit`,
and `cursor`. The daemon rejects binary files. Files above the 256 KiB
full-snapshot
cap require at least one explicit window argument (`line`, `limit`, or
`maxBytes`); a request with none of them remains `file_too_large`. Such a
window is streamed, and its returned UTF-8 content stays capped at 256 KiB.
`maxBytes` always applies to the UTF-8 response bytes after decoding, including
when the source uses another supported encoding within the full-snapshot cap.

Line offsets are resolved by scanning from the start of the file, so a window
is also refused with `file_too_large` when reaching it would read more than
8 MiB (`MAX_TEXT_SCAN_BYTES`). Use `GET /file/bytes` to reach a deeper offset
directly. Large text in an encoding the route cannot decode returns
`binary_file`, not `file_too_large` — retrying with a smaller window cannot
help, and `readBytes` is the same remedy that already applies to binary.

For files within the full-snapshot cap, the response includes `hash`, a SHA-256
digest over the raw on-disk bytes for the whole file, even when `line`, `limit`,
or `maxBytes` returned a slice. Large partial windows omit `hash`, retain the
complete `sizeBytes`, set `truncated: true`, and return
`originalLineCount: null` when the stream stops before EOF.

##### Paging with `cursor`

Requires the `workspace_file_read_cursor` capability. A response that has more
to give returns `hasMore: true` and, when a file byte offset is derivable, a
`nextCursor` token. Passing it back as `cursor` resumes in O(1), where a deep
`line` offset costs a scan from byte 0 and is refused past 8 MiB.

```
GET /file?path=big.log&limit=500          → { content, nextCursor, hasMore: true }
GET /file?path=big.log&limit=500&cursor=… → next page
```

`cursor` and `line` are mutually exclusive (`parse_error`) — both name a
starting point. A malformed or over-long cursor is `parse_error`; a cursor
whose file has been replaced or truncated is `hash_mismatch` (409). Appending
does **not** invalidate an outstanding cursor, which is the case the feature
exists for.

`content` omits the terminating newline of its last line, as every other read
does, so a client reassembling pages joins them with `\n`. `hasMore` is not a
restatement of `nextCursor`: a small non-UTF-8 file read with a `limit` has
more content but no derivable byte offset, so it reports `hasMore: true` with
`nextCursor: null`. The cursor is also null when the byte cap cuts the current
line, because resuming from that offset would return a partial line. For many
short lines, lower `limit` until the page ends before the byte cap and returns
a cursor. For a single oversized line, request the following line explicitly
(for example, `line=2` when starting at line 1), then continue with cursors;
use `GET /file/bytes` when the complete oversized line is required.

```json
{
  "kind": "file",
  "path": "src/index.ts",
  "content": "export {};\n",
  "encoding": "utf-8",
  "bom": false,
  "lineEnding": "lf",
  "sizeBytes": 11,
  "returnedBytes": 11,
  "truncated": false,
  "hash": "sha256:...",
  "matchedIgnore": null,
  "originalLineCount": null
}
```

#### `GET /file/bytes`

Reads raw bytes from a file without decoding. Query params: `path` (required),
`offset` (default `0`), and `maxBytes` (default `65536`, max `262144`). This
route supports bounded windows on large binary files without slurping the whole
file. The response includes `hash` only when the returned window covers the
entire file.

```json
{
  "kind": "file_bytes",
  "path": "assets/logo.png",
  "offset": 0,
  "sizeBytes": 3912,
  "returnedBytes": 3912,
  "truncated": false,
  "contentBase64": "...",
  "hash": "sha256:..."
}
```

#### `POST /file/write`

Creates or replaces a text file. This is a strict mutation route: on loopback
without a configured token it returns `401 { "code": "token_required" }`.
With `--require-auth`, the global bearer middleware rejects unauthenticated
requests before the route runs.

Body:

```json
{
  "path": "src/new.ts",
  "content": "export const value = 1;\n",
  "mode": "create"
}
```

```json
{
  "path": "src/existing.ts",
  "content": "export const value = 2;\n",
  "mode": "replace",
  "expectedHash": "sha256:..."
}
```

`mode` must be `create` or `replace`. `create` never overwrites an existing
file (`409 file_already_exists`). `replace` requires `expectedHash`; missing or
malformed hashes are `400 parse_error`, and stale hashes are
`409 hash_mismatch`. `expectedHash` is `sha256:` plus 64 lowercase hex
characters, computed over raw on-disk bytes.

`bom`, `encoding`, and `lineEnding` may be supplied. Replacement preserves the
existing file's encoding profile by default; explicit fields override it.
Binary writes are out of scope.

The daemon writes to a random temp file in the target directory, fsyncs where
supported, re-checks the current hash immediately before `rename()`, then
renames into place. This prevents partial-file observation and serializes
daemon-originated writes to the same file, but it is not a cross-process
kernel compare-and-swap: an external editor can still race in the tiny window
between final hash check and rename.

```json
{
  "kind": "file_write",
  "path": "src/existing.ts",
  "mode": "replace",
  "created": false,
  "sizeBytes": 24,
  "hash": "sha256:...",
  "encoding": "utf-8",
  "bom": false,
  "lineEnding": "lf",
  "matchedIgnore": null
}
```

#### `POST /file/edit`

Applies one exact text replacement to an existing text file. This is also a
strict mutation route and requires `expectedHash`.

```json
{
  "path": "src/config.ts",
  "oldText": "timeout: 30000",
  "newText": "timeout: 60000",
  "expectedHash": "sha256:..."
}
```

`oldText` must be non-empty and occur exactly once. No match returns
`422 text_not_found`; multiple matches return `422 ambiguous_text_match`.
The route preserves encoding, BOM, and line endings, and re-checks
`expectedHash` immediately before the atomic rename.

Explicit writes/edits to ignored paths are allowed because the authenticated
caller named the path. Success responses and audit events include
`matchedIgnore: "file" | "directory" | null`.

```json
{
  "kind": "file_edit",
  "path": "src/config.ts",
  "replacements": 1,
  "sizeBytes": 128,
  "hash": "sha256:...",
  "encoding": "utf-8",
  "bom": false,
  "lineEnding": "lf",
  "matchedIgnore": null
}
```

### `GET /session/:id/context`

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "sessionId": "<sid>",
  "workspaceCwd": "/canonical/path",
  "state": {
    "models": {},
    "modes": {},
    "configOptions": []
  }
}
```

`state` mirrors the same ACP model/mode/config-option shapes used by
`POST /session`, `POST /session/:id/load`, and `POST /session/:id/resume`.

### `GET /session/:id/supported-commands`

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "sessionId": "<sid>",
  "availableCommands": [
    {
      "name": "init",
      "description": "Initialize the project",
      "input": null,
      "_meta": { "source": "builtin" }
    }
  ],
  "availableSkills": ["review"]
}
```

`availableCommands` is the same command snapshot used by the
`available_commands_update` SSE notification. `availableSkills` lists skill
names only; clients must not expect skill bodies or paths over this route.

### `GET /session/:id/tasks`

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "sessionId": "<sid>",
  "now": 1700000000000,
  "tasks": [
    {
      "kind": "agent",
      "id": "agent-1",
      "label": "reviewer: check failure",
      "description": "check failure",
      "status": "running",
      "startTime": 1699999999000,
      "runtimeMs": 1000,
      "outputFile": "/tmp/agent-1.jsonl",
      "isBackgrounded": true,
      "subagentType": "reviewer"
    },
    {
      "kind": "agent",
      "id": "agent-2",
      "label": "general-purpose: run the failing test",
      "description": "run the failing test",
      "status": "running",
      "startTime": 1699999999500,
      "runtimeMs": 500,
      "outputFile": "/tmp/agent-2.jsonl",
      "isBackgrounded": false,
      "subagentType": "general-purpose",
      "parentAgentId": "agent-1",
      "parentName": "reviewer",
      "depth": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This route is a read-only out-of-band snapshot. It is intentionally not a
prompt and can be queried while the session is streaming. The response only
contains whitelisted metadata from the agent, shell, and monitor task
registries; controllers, timers, offsets, pending messages, and raw registry
objects are never exposed.

Agent tasks spawned by another sub-agent (nested sub-agents, bounded by
`maxSubagentDepth`) carry three optional lineage fields: `parentAgentId` (the
spawning agent task's `id`), `parentName` (the spawning agent's
`subagentType`, captured at registration so it survives the parent's eviction
from the registry), and `depth` (0-based launch depth; 0 = spawned by the
top-level session). Agents launched by the top-level session omit
`parentAgentId` and `parentName`; clients should treat all three fields as
optional and fall back to a flat list when they are absent.

### `GET /session/:id/lsp`

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "sessionId": "<sid>",
  "workspaceCwd": "/canonical/path",
  "enabled": true,
  "configuredServers": 1,
  "readyServers": 1,
  "failedServers": 0,
  "inProgressServers": 0,
  "notStartedServers": 0,
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "typescript",
      "status": "READY",
      "languages": ["typescript", "javascript"],
      "transport": "stdio",
      "command": "typescript-language-server"
    }
  ]
}
```

`status` is one of `NOT_STARTED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `READY`, or `FAILED`.
Optional `error` is present on failed servers when available. Disabled LSP
(including bare mode) returns HTTP 200 with `enabled: false`, zero counts, and
`servers: []`. LSP enabled with no configured servers returns `enabled: true`,
`configuredServers: 0`, and `servers: []`. If initialization fails before the
client exists, the response may include `initializationError`; if a live client
cannot provide a snapshot, the response includes `statusUnavailable: true`.

This route exposes only stable client-facing fields. It intentionally omits
debug internals such as process IDs, spawn args, stderr tails, root URIs, and
workspace-folder paths.

### `POST /session`

Spawn a new agent or attach to an existing one (under `sessionScope: 'single'`, the default).

Request:

```json
{
  "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/workspace",
  "modelServiceId": "qwen-prod",
  "sessionId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "sessionScope": "thread"
}
```

| ---------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `cwd`            | no       | Absolute path matching one registered workspace. If omitted, the route falls back to the primary workspace (read it off `/capabilities.workspaceCwd`). A mismatched non-empty `cwd` returns `400 workspace_mismatch`. When `features` contains `multi_workspace_sessions`, clients may pass any trusted `workspaces[].cwd`; otherwise only the primary workspace is accepted. Workspace paths are canonicalized via `realpathSync.native` (with a resolve-only fallback for non-existent paths) so case-insensitive filesystems don't reject sessions per spelling.                                                      |
| `modelServiceId` | no       | Selects which configured _model service_ the agent will route through (the back-end provider — Alibaba ModelStudio, OpenRouter, etc). If omitted the agent uses its default. If the workspace already has a session, this calls `setSessionModel` on the existing one and broadcasts `model_switched`. Distinct from `modelId` on `POST /session/:id/model`, which selects the model **within** an already-bound service. The `modelServices` array on `/capabilities` is reserved for advertising configured services; in Stage 1 it is always `[]` (the agent's default service is used and not enumerated over HTTP). |
| `sessionId`      | no       | RFC-variant UUID v1-v5 chosen by the caller. The daemon normalizes it to lowercase and always creates a fresh thread session; it never treats this field as an idempotent attach. Confirm that `caps.features` contains `session_id_override` before sending it because older daemons may ignore unknown fields. `null` is equivalent to omission.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `sessionScope`   | no       | Per-request override for session sharing. `'single'` (the daemon-wide default) makes a second same-workspace `POST /session` reuse the existing session (`attached: true`); `'thread'` forces a fresh distinct session every call. Omit to inherit the daemon-wide default. Values outside the enum return `400 { code: 'invalid_session_scope' }`. Old daemons (pre-#4175 PR 5) silently ignore the field — pre-flight `caps.features.session_scope_override` before sending. The daemon-wide default is hardcoded to `'single'` in production today; #4175 may add a `--sessionScope` CLI flag in a follow-up.         |

Response:

```json
{
  "sessionId": "<uuid>",
  "workspaceCwd": "/canonical/path",
  "attached": false
}
```

`attached: true` means a session for that workspace already existed and you're now sharing it.

Caller-supplied IDs are unique across all currently registered workspace runtimes and every still-live bridge generation, including draining replacements. A live, pending, active, archived, or worktree-backed duplicate returns `409 session_id_conflict`. Invalid values return `400 invalid_session_id`; an unavailable live-owner or persisted-state check returns retryable `503 session_id_admission_unavailable`. Retry with bounded backoff after bridge or storage health changes; `retryable` means another attempt is safe, not that an immediate retry will succeed. If the downstream agent returns a different ID, the daemon removes that orphan and returns `500 session_id_not_honored`. After an ambiguous response, load or resume the known ID instead of retrying create as an attach.

Multi-client integrations that want independent conversations should send
`sessionScope: "thread"` on each `POST /session`. Use the default `single`
scope only when clients intentionally share one collaborative session; shared
sessions serialize prompts through one FIFO, visible through
`/daemon/status` as `runtime.activity.pendingPrompts` and
`runtime.activity.queuedPrompts`.

Concurrent `POST /session` calls for the same workspace are **coalesced** to one spawn — both callers get the same `sessionId`, exactly one reports `attached: false`. If the underlying spawn fails (init timeout, malformed agent output, OOM), **all coalesced callers receive the same error** — the in-flight slot is cleared so a follow-up call can retry from scratch.

### ACP `session/new` caller-supplied ID

ACP clients request the same behavior through the extension metadata field:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "session/new",
  "params": {
    "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/workspace",
    "_meta": {
      "qwen-code/sessionId": "550E8400-E29B-41D4-A716-446655440000"
    }
  }
}
```

The response contains the normalized lowercase ID. Primary and workspace-qualified ACP mounts share admission with REST, including `session/load` and `session/resume`. Invalid IDs use ACP `INVALID_PARAMS` with `data.httpStatus=400` and `data.errorKind="invalid_session_id"`; conflicts use `data.httpStatus=409`; unavailable live-owner or persisted-state checks use `data.httpStatus=503` and `data.retryable=true`.

An ACP-created session that never receives a prompt leaves no persisted trace, and the daemon reaps it when its owning connection closes with zero attached sessions. After that reap the same ID can be created again — that is connection lifecycle, not ID reuse: while the connection (or any attachment) is live, admission rejects the duplicate.

### `POST /session/:id/load`

Restore a persisted ACP session by id and replay its history through SSE. The path id is authoritative; any `sessionId` field in the body is ignored. Pre-flight `caps.features.session_load` — older daemons return `404` for this route.

Request:

```json
{
  "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/workspace"

| `cwd` | no       | Same canonicalization + `workspace_mismatch` rules as `POST /session`. Omit to inherit `/capabilities.workspaceCwd`. When `features` contains `multi_workspace_sessions`, callers may pass any trusted registered `workspaces[].cwd`; untrusted non-primary workspaces return `403 untrusted_workspace`. `mcpServers` is intentionally NOT accepted here — daemon-wide MCP is settings-driven (matches `POST /session`). |

Response:

```json
{
  "sessionId": "persisted-1",
  "workspaceCwd": "/canonical/path",
  "attached": false,
  "state": {
    "models": { ... },
    "modes": { ... },
    "configOptions": [ ... ]
  }
}
```

`state` mirrors ACP's `LoadSessionResponse` — `models` is a `SessionModelState`, `modes` a `SessionModeState`, `configOptions` an array of `SessionConfigOption`. Missing fields are agent-decided. Late attachers (the `attached: true` paths below) get the SAME `state` snapshot the original load caller saw — the daemon caches it on the entry; runtime mutations (e.g. `model_switched`) are delivered on the SSE stream, not on subsequent attach responses.

`attached: true` means the session was already live (either from a prior `session/load`/`session/resume`, or because a coalesced concurrent caller raced just ahead).

**History replay over SSE.** While `loadSession` is in flight on the agent side, the agent may emit `session_update` notifications for persisted turns, or return bulk replay updates in the response metadata. The daemon seeds those events into the session's bounded replay snapshot window before the route response returns. For live sessions, `POST /session/:id/load` only promises that bounded window (`compactedReplay`, `liveJournal`, `lastEventId`), not the full transcript. The window is byte-capped by `--compacted-replay-max-bytes` (default 4 MiB, maximum 256 MiB); if older replay entries were dropped, `compactedReplay[0]` is an id-less `history_truncated` marker. The in-flight `liveJournal` is separately capped by `--max-journal-events` (default 10 000 replay entries) and `--max-journal-bytes` (default 8 MiB of serialized source events). These are per-session **baseline** caps. When an in-flight turn outgrows them, the daemon first tries adaptive growth: it raises that session's caps toward double (up to a per-session hard cap of 256 MiB, entries scaled proportionally, limited by the remaining pool headroom) while the growth granted across every live session fits in one daemon-wide growth pool sized at 5% of the daemon's effective memory budget — the `--memory-budget-mb` value when passed, capped at resolved available memory, otherwise 50% of auto-detected memory — capped at `1024` MB. Accounting is daemon-wide — a multi-workspace daemon runs one bridge per workspace and all of them share the single pool. Growth is on demand and only as far as the pool allows; an operator-pinned `--max-journal-events` or `--max-journal-bytes` disables it, as does a host whose effective budget falls below the 1024 MB minimum (`insufficientMemory`): the pool is 0 and adaptive growth is disabled outright. Consecutive compatible `agent_message_chunk` or `agent_thought_chunk` source events share a replay entry, up to 256 source events per entry, while tool, attribution, provenance, and discrete-message boundaries remain intact. When the journal still exceeds its (possibly grown) caps after the growth the pool allows — including when no headroom is granted or a grant covers only part of the overshoot — the oldest entries are dropped whole (so the retained tail can be much smaller than the byte cap) and a `history_truncated` marker with `scope: 'live_journal'` is prepended; its `truncatedEvents` and `retainedEvents` fields count source events, not replay entries, and its `maxBytes` / `maxEvents` reflect the caps in force (which may already have grown). Clients should render that marker as status and continue applying retained events. Full persisted transcript access is exposed separately through `GET /session/:id/transcript`.

The replay-window byte caps apply after the child has reconstructed the persisted transcript; they do not cap the on-disk JSONL read. A restore that exceeds the daemon budget returns `504` with a `Retry-After` derived from the restore budget (clamped to 5-120s) and `{code: "session_restore_timeout", errorKind: "restore_timeout", retryable: true, sessionId, action, timeoutMs}`. The daemon fences the still-running ACP request and cleans up any late session instead of registering it. A retry for the same id returns `409 restore_in_progress` with `reason: "awaiting_abandoned_cleanup"` and a `Retry-After` of the restore budget (clamped to 5-120s) until that cleanup settles. If late cleanup is uncertain, or the abandoned restore has still not settled a full restore budget after its deadline, new sessions on that workspace return `503 acp_channel_unavailable` with `reason: "restore_cleanup_failed"` or `"restore_settlement_overdue"`; already-live sessions remain usable while the channel drains.

**Errors:**

- `404` — persisted session id doesn't exist (`SessionNotFoundError`).
- `400` — `workspace_mismatch` (same shape as `POST /session`).
- `403` — `untrusted_workspace` when `cwd` targets an untrusted non-primary workspace.
- `503` — `session_limit_exceeded` (counts against `--max-sessions`; in-flight restores are accounted for too).
- `504` — `session_restore_timeout`; retryable, with a `Retry-After` derived from the restore budget (clamped to 5-120s) because the same session id stays fenced until late cleanup settles.
- `503` — `acp_channel_unavailable` when the workspace channel is closed to new session work. `reason` says why: `restore_cleanup_failed` when an abandoned restore could not be cleaned up conclusively, or `restore_settlement_overdue` when an abandoned restore has still not settled one full restore budget after its deadline. In both cases existing sessions remain available, and new session work may be retried after the workspace channel drains — the body carries `retryAfterSeconds` and the header a matching budget-derived `Retry-After`, because quarantine outlives the fence and a fresh id never sees the 409 that would carry the hint.
- `409` — `restore_in_progress` (a `session/resume` for the same id is already in flight, or a fresh spawn supplied an id a restore owns). `Retry-After: 5` while the restore is active; a budget-derived hint once it is fenced as `awaiting_abandoned_cleanup`. Same-action races (two concurrent `session/load` for the same id) coalesce — exactly one returns `attached: false`, the rest return `attached: true` with the same `state`.
- `409` — `session_workspace_conflict` when the same session id is already live or being restored by another workspace runtime.
- `409` — `session_archived` when the id exists only under `chats/archive/`; call `POST /sessions/unarchive` before `load` or `resume`.
- `409` — `session_archiving` when archive or unarchive is in flight for the same id. `Retry-After: 5`.
- `409` — `session_conflict` when the id exists in both `chats/` and `chats/archive/`; delete the session with `POST /sessions/delete` before loading.

### `GET /session/:id/transcript`

Return one page of id-less `session_update` replay frames reconstructed from the active persisted JSONL transcript. Pre-flight `caps.features.session_transcript` — older daemons return `404` for this route.

| -------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cursor` | no       | Opaque base64url cursor returned by the previous page. Omit for the first page. The cursor is daemon-issued and tamper-checked; modifying it returns `400 invalid_transcript_cursor`. It binds to the transcript file identity and frozen first-page byte size; deleting, truncating, replacing, or archiving the file invalidates it and returns `409`. |
| `limit`  | no       | Number of active `ChatRecord`s to include in the page. Defaults to `100`, maximum `500`. One record can produce multiple replay frames, so `events.length` may be larger than `limit`. Invalid values return `400 invalid_transcript_limit`.                                                                                                             |

Response:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "sessionId": "persisted-1",
  "events": [
    {
      "v": 1,
      "type": "session_update",
      "data": {
        "sessionUpdate": "user_message_chunk",
        "content": { "type": "text", "text": "..." }
      }
    }
  ],
  "nextCursor": "opaque",
  "hasMore": true,
  "startTime": "2026-07-08T00:00:00.000Z",
  "lastUpdated": "2026-07-08T00:01:00.000Z"
}
```

`events` are replay frames only: `{ v: 1, type: "session_update", data: SessionUpdate }`. They do not carry EventBus ids, and the response never includes `lastEventId`. Calling this route does not call `/load`, attach a client, seed the live EventBus, create a live session, or change the current live replay window. Live and inactive active sessions are both reconstructed by the child-side read-only status method so replay uses the same workspace settings, runtime output directory, emitters, and `/load` history semantics without mutating daemon session state.

The first page freezes the current JSONL snapshot size. Later pages read only that byte prefix, so appends after page 1 do not change the result set. If the file disappears, is truncated below the frozen size, is replaced with a different inode, or is moved to archive, the next page returns `409` and the client should restart from page 1 or ask the user to reopen the transcript.

To protect daemon memory and latency, snapshots above the transcript indexing cap fail before the daemon scans the JSONL. Clients receive `413 transcript_too_large` and should fall back to export/offline processing or ask the user to shorten/archive older history.

`partial: true` and `replayError` may appear if replay conversion fails after producing some frames. Partial responses never include `nextCursor`, so clients cannot silently paginate past records that were not converted.

**Errors:**

- `400` — invalid `limit`, `cursor`, or session id shape.
- `404` — active persisted session id does not exist on the first page request.
- `409` — `session_archived`, `session_archiving`, or `session_conflict` from the same loadability checks as `/load`.
- `409` — transcript snapshot is unavailable because the file was deleted, truncated, replaced, or archived after the cursor was issued; this also applies when preflight can no longer find the active file for a cursor request.
- `413` — `transcript_too_large` when the frozen transcript snapshot exceeds the daemon indexing cap.
- `413` — `transcript_page_too_large` when one aggregate record exceeds the workspace-qualified page budget or the serialized page exceeds its response budget.

### `GET /workspaces/:workspace/session/:id/transcript`

Return the same `DaemonSessionTranscriptPage` projection as the singular route from the selected registered workspace's active persisted JSONL. Pre-flight `workspace_persisted_transcript`; this capability is independent of `multi_workspace_sessions` and works for a trusted single-workspace primary selected by id or cwd.

The selector and query parameters follow the existing plural workspace and transcript rules. Trusted primary and secondary runtimes and untrusted secondary runtimes may read. An untrusted primary returns `403 untrusted_workspace`. Archived content is not returned.

For this workspace-qualified route, `limit` is the maximum record count. A page may stop earlier at the 4 MiB persisted-source budget and return a continuation cursor. Serialized responses are capped at 32 MiB and cursors at 64 KiB. If replay state would exceed the cursor cap, the page returns its successfully converted events with `partial: true`, `hasMore: false`, and no `nextCursor`.

Unlike the legacy singular route, this path is implemented entirely inside the daemon process. It does not call the workspace bridge, start ACP, load settings, parse project-defined agents or skills, or create/repair `session-transcript-cursor-key`. Tool frames use persisted tool names and descriptions without consulting the runtime tool registry. Its HMAC cursor key exists only in daemon memory, is isolated per workspace, and rotates on restart; a cursor from a previous daemon process returns `400 invalid_transcript_cursor`.

### `GET /workspaces/:workspace/session/:id/export`

Export the selected registered workspace's active persisted session as an attachment. Pre-flight `workspace_session_export`; do not infer support from `session_export` or `workspace_qualified_rest_core`. The selector resolves as exact workspace id first, then as a URL-encoded absolute cwd after canonicalization. Both primary and secondary runtimes must be trusted. An untrusted runtime returns `403 untrusted_workspace` before session or format validation.

The optional `format` query is `html` (default), `md`, `json`, or `jsonl`. The body, MIME type, filename sanitization, `Cache-Control: no-store`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, and attachment disposition match `GET /session/:id/export`. The legacy route remains bound to primary storage.

The plural route reads only the selected workspace's active persisted JSONL under the existing shared archive coordinator. It does not scan other workspace stores, fall back to primary, resolve a live owner, call the workspace bridge, start ACP, attach a client, or load settings. A session id that exists only in another workspace returns `404 { code: "session_not_found" }`; archived sessions return `409 session_archived`. Invalid formats return `400 invalid_export_format`, and storage races retain the existing `session_archiving` and `session_conflict` errors.

### `GET /workspaces/:workspace/session/:id/archive/export`

Export the selected registered workspace's archived persisted session as an attachment. Pre-flight `workspace_archived_session_export`; support cannot be inferred from active export or plural core capabilities. Workspace selector resolution and trust checks run before session-id and format validation.

TypeScript SDK callers use `WorkspaceDaemonClient.exportArchivedSession(sessionId, options)`. The method always uses native REST and returns the existing `DaemonSessionExportResult` attachment projection.

The optional `format` query, response body, MIME type, sanitized filename, cache policy, security header, and attachment disposition are identical to the active workspace export. Archived source JSONL is capped at 256 MiB before reconstruction; a larger file returns `413 transcript_too_large` with `sessionId`, `snapshotSize`, and `maxBytes`. The active export keeps its existing size behavior.

The route reads only `chats/archive/<id>.jsonl` in the selected trusted workspace under a shared archive-coordinator lease. It does not inspect active content for fallback, scan another workspace, resolve a live owner, call a bridge, start ACP, attach a client, or load settings. An active-only id returns `409 { code: "session_not_archived" }`; a missing id returns `404 { code: "session_not_found" }`; simultaneous active and archived files return `409 session_conflict`; and an archive transition returns `409 session_archiving` with `Retry-After: 5`.

### `POST /session/:id/resume`

Restore a persisted ACP session by id WITHOUT replaying history through SSE. The model context is restored internally on the agent side (via `geminiClient.initialize` reading `config.getResumedSessionData`); the SSE stream stays clean for clients that already have history rendered. Pre-flight `caps.features.session_resume`; `unstable_session_resume` remains a deprecated compatibility alias for older clients.

Same request shape as `/load`. Same response shape — `state` mirrors ACP's `ResumeSessionResponse`. Same error envelope, including `409 restore_in_progress` (which fires when a `session/load` is in flight; `session/resume` racing behind another `session/resume` coalesces).

Use `/load` when the client has no history rendered (cold reconnect, picker → open). Use `/resume` when the client already has the turns on screen and only needs the daemon-side handle back.

> ⚠️ **Why is `unstable_session_resume` still advertised?** The daemon's HTTP route and `session_resume` capability are stable for v1, but the bridge still calls ACP's `connection.unstable_resumeSession`. The old tag remains only so SDKs that shipped before `session_resume` can keep working.

### `GET /workspace/:id/session-info` and `GET /workspaces/:workspace/session-info`

Return aggregate persisted session counts for the selected workspace without changing the paginated session-list path:

```json
{
  "active": 450,
  "archived": 30,
  "total": 480,
  "live": 2,
  "expensive": true,
  "cost": "disk_scan"
}
```

`active`, `archived`, and `total` count local JSONL sessions. `live` is the matching in-memory bridge count and is omitted for a registered untrusted secondary workspace because that persisted-only read must not query live state. `expensive` is always `true` and `cost` is always `"disk_scan"`; clients must call this endpoint infrequently rather than poll it. If the scan reaches its safety limit or cannot classify every candidate file, the response adds `"truncated": true` and the persisted counts are lower bounds. Missing storage returns zero persisted counts. The plural route uses the same workspace selector and trust policy as the plural session catalog; an untrusted primary still returns `403 untrusted_workspace`.

The TypeScript daemon SDK exposes the plural route through `workspaceById(...)` or `workspaceByCwd(...)`, followed by `getWorkspaceSessionInfo()`.

### `GET /workspace/:id/sessions` and `GET /workspaces/:workspace/sessions`

List sessions whose canonical workspace matches `:id` or `:workspace`. The path parameter first resolves as an exact workspace id and then as a URL-encoded absolute cwd. Primary workspaces include the existing persisted/live merge: the default list is active sessions from `chats/`; pass `archiveState=archived` to list archived sessions from `chats/archive/`. Trusted non-primary workspaces include active persisted sessions from their own `chats/` store and merge matching live summaries without duplicates; if no active persisted sessions exist, the route preserves the previous live-only cursor behavior. Trusted non-primary workspaces also support `archiveState=archived`, the organized `view=organized` list, and `group` filters, reading from their own `chats/`, `chats/archive/`, and session-organization stores; a combined `view=organized&archiveState=archived` query returns only archived sessions without a live merge. Registered untrusted non-primary workspaces support the same list, filter, and pagination shapes but return persisted entries only: the daemon does not query the live bridge or populate pending interactions, turn errors, or client state from the runtime. Persisted defaults such as `clientCount: 0` and `hasActivePrompt: false` remain present for wire compatibility. Missing storage returns an empty list. The plural route still returns `403 { code: "untrusted_workspace" }` for an untrusted primary; legacy primary routes keep their existing compatibility behavior. `archiveState=all` is not supported in v1. Primary and persisted-backed lists keep the existing numeric `cursor` semantics; the no-persisted trusted non-primary live fallback keeps its existing opaque live cursor.

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:4170/workspace/$(jq -rn --arg c "$PWD" '$c|@uri')/sessions
curl http://127.0.0.1:4170/workspace/$(jq -rn --arg c "$PWD" '$c|@uri')/sessions?archiveState=archived
curl http://127.0.0.1:4170/workspaces/<workspace-id>/sessions
```

When `workspace_qualified_rest_core` is advertised, workspace-scoped session batch operations, group CRUD, and session organization mutation are available under `/workspaces/:workspace/sessions/{delete,archive,unarchive}`, `/workspaces/:workspace/session-groups`, and `/workspaces/:workspace/session/:id/organization`. For an untrusted secondary, group GET remains available; every group, session, and organization mutation remains trust-gated. Workspace-less batch and organization mutation routes remain primary-workspace-only for compatibility.

| `cursor`       | no       | Pagination cursor from the previous response.                                                                                                                                                   |
| `size`         | no       | Page size. Invalid values return `400 { code: "invalid_cursor" }` or the existing page-size validation.                                                                                         |
| `view`         | no       | Omit for the legacy recent list. `organized` opts into server-side pinned/group ordering and adds optional organization fields. Any other value returns `400 { code: "invalid_session_view" }`. |
| `group`        | no       | Only meaningful with `view=organized`. `all` (default), `pinned`, `ungrouped`, or a custom group id. Unknown group ids return `404 { code: "group_not_found" }`.                                |

Response:

```json
{
  "sessions": [
    {
      "sessionId": "<uuid>",
      "workspaceCwd": "/canonical/path",
      "createdAt": "2026-05-17T08:30:00.000Z",
      "displayName": "My Session",
      "clientCount": 2,
      "hasActivePrompt": false,
      "isArchived": false
    }
  ],
  "nextCursor": 1772251200000
}
```

With `view=organized`, the daemon reads `<Storage.getProjectDir(cwd)>/session-organization.v1.json`, returns pinned sessions first, then activity time descending, and then `sessionId` for stable ties. The organized cursor is opaque base64url JSON and must not be reused with the legacy recent list. `pinned` is a virtual filter, not a group. `groupId: null` means ungrouped. Archived sessions keep their organization metadata, but `archiveState=archived&view=organized` still returns only archived sessions.

Additional fields may appear on each session when `view=organized`:

```json
{
  "isPinned": true,
  "pinnedAt": "2026-07-04T12:00:00.000Z",
  "groupId": "018f..."
}
```

Trusted active lists include live daemon overlay fields such as `clientCount` and `hasActivePrompt`. Untrusted-secondary and archived lists are storage-only: live overlay fields remain absent or false, and archived entries set `isArchived` to `true`. Empty array (not 404) when no sessions exist — a session-picker UI shouldn't error just because the workspace is idle.

### `GET /workspaces/:workspace/sessions/live-state`

Return the selected workspace runtime's memory-only live-session snapshot plus an in-memory catalog version, so clients can stop polling the persisted catalog at `GET /workspaces/:workspace/sessions` for volatile state such as `hasActivePrompt`, waiting flags, and `clientCount`. Pre-flight `workspace_session_live_state`; the tag is independent of `workspace_qualified_rest_core`, so older daemons advertising the broader workspace REST capability do not implement this route. The selector resolves as exact workspace id first, then as a URL-encoded absolute cwd after canonicalization, matching the other plural session routes. The route is trusted-only for primary and secondary runtimes alike: it never falls back to the primary runtime, and it does not use the permissive persisted-catalog policy that grants an untrusted secondary bounded catalog reads. The endpoint has no query parameters and performs no session storage, settings, external command, or ACP round trips, so its cost is independent of persisted session count and JSONL size; the default live-session cap keeps the response bounded, and with the cap disabled cost stays proportional only to the number of live sessions.

Response:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "catalogVersion": {
    "generation": "7eca3164-bce1-4f50-94d8-c842c480f213",
    "revision": 17
  },
  "sessions": [
    {
      "sessionId": "session-123",
      "clientCount": 1,
      "hasActivePrompt": true,
      "isWaitingForPermission": false,
      "isWaitingForUserQuestion": false
    }
  ]
}
```

`v` is the response schema version. Every successful response includes `Cache-Control: no-store`. `sessions` is the complete, unpaginated, unordered set of sessions currently live in the selected runtime; an empty live runtime returns `200` with `sessions: []`. `clientCount`, `hasActivePrompt`, `isWaitingForPermission`, and `isWaitingForUserQuestion` are required wire fields, and missing optional bridge values project to `0` or `false`. Static catalog fields such as display name, timestamps, organization, and source metadata are deliberately excluded and remain owned by the full catalog. An absent live-state row only clears a known catalog row's volatile fields; it never deletes a persisted catalog row.

`catalogVersion` is an equality token for daemon-observed catalog changes. `generation` is a random UUID created with each bridge instance and changes on daemon restart or workspace runtime replacement; `revision` starts at zero and increases monotonically within a generation. The only supported operation is equality over the whole pair: same generation and revision means no daemon-observed catalog change, and any difference means reload the full catalog. Clients must not perform revision arithmetic or compare revisions across generations, and conservative extra increments are allowed. The version covers catalog membership and static metadata changes observed by the daemon; ordinary turn activity, prompt lifecycle, attach/detach, and waiting-state transitions do not advance it because the live snapshot already carries the corresponding volatile fields. Two volatile overlay values are deliberately outside both signals: turn-error state (`hasTurnError`/`turnError`) and the pending-interaction count/content (`pendingInteractionCount`/`pendingInteractions`) neither advance the version nor appear in the snapshot, so a client that needs them must keep reading the per-session event stream or the full catalog rather than relying on this route; either field can be added wire-additively when a concrete consumer requires it. Mutations written directly by another daemon, a TUI, or an external process are not observed, so once a client stops periodic full-catalog polling those writes have no bounded discovery time and surface only after an explicit full reload, another observed catalog mutation, reconnect, or daemon/runtime replacement.

Clients reconcile a catalog bundle with a two-read handshake: read live-state A, load the full session list (plus `GET /workspaces/:workspace/session-groups` when the client consumes `session_organization`), then read live-state B. Equal A and B versions accept the bundle; differing versions mark the catalog stale and coalesce at most one trailing reload rather than entering a tight retry loop. Every accepted catalog request must be initiated after A — a request or deduplicated promise that began before A cannot satisfy the reconciliation. Version-driven reloads are single-flight per workspace and obey a non-zero background minimum interval, so sustained catalog churn cannot drive one full catalog scan per live-state poll; explicit local mutations may still request an immediate refresh through the same single-flight operation.

**Errors:**

- `400` — existing selector-validation or `workspace_mismatch` behavior for an unknown, malformed, nested, or unregistered selector; the route never resolves an unknown selector to the primary runtime.
- `403` — `untrusted_workspace` for any untrusted runtime, including an untrusted primary.
- `503` — `workspace_runtime_unavailable` with `Retry-After` for a bootstrapping, transitioning, draining, blocked, or removed runtime, or a runtime generation that closes mid-request.
- `500` — unexpected local errors use the existing bridge error mapping.

### `GET /workspace/:id/session-groups`

List user-defined session groups for a workspace. The singular GET selector accepts any registered workspace id or URL-encoded canonical cwd. The plural GET alias is also available to an untrusted secondary and reads only the organization sidecar. Plural group mutations remain trust-gated, while singular group mutations retain their primary-only compatibility behavior. Pre-flight `caps.features.includes('session_organization')`.

Response:

```json
{
  "groups": [
    {
      "id": "018f...",
      "name": "Frontend",
      "color": "blue",
      "order": 0,
      "createdAt": "2026-07-04T12:00:00.000Z",
      "updatedAt": "2026-07-04T12:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "colorOptions": ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple"]
}
```

Colors are protocol tokens only; clients localize display names. No default color-named groups are created.

### `POST /workspace/:id/session-groups`

Create a custom session group. Strict mutation gate. Pre-flight `caps.features.includes('session_organization')`.

Request:

```json
{ "name": "Frontend", "color": "blue" }
```

`name` is trimmed, must be 1-64 characters, cannot contain control characters, and is unique within the workspace by case-insensitive trimmed comparison. Duplicate names return `409 { code: "group_name_conflict" }`. `color` must be one of the returned `colorOptions`.

Response:

```json
{
  "group": {
    "id": "018f...",
    "name": "Frontend",
    "color": "blue",
    "order": 0,
    "createdAt": "...",
    "updatedAt": "..."
  }
}
```

### `PATCH /workspace/:id/session-groups/:groupId`

Update a custom session group. Strict mutation gate. Pre-flight `caps.features.includes('session_organization')`. Body fields are optional: `{ "name"?: string, "color"?: string, "order"?: number }`. Unknown group ids return `404 { code: "group_not_found" }`; duplicate/invalid names and colors use the same errors as create.

### `DELETE /workspace/:id/session-groups/:groupId`

Delete a custom session group. Strict mutation gate. Pre-flight `caps.features.includes('session_organization')`. Sessions referencing the group are cleared to `groupId: null`; pinned state is preserved. Response is `{ "deleted": true }` when a group was removed and `{ "deleted": false }` when the id did not exist.

### `POST /sessions/delete`

Hard-delete one or more persisted session JSONL files. The daemon first best-effort closes live sessions, then removes the active or archived JSONL. If both active and archived copies exist for the same id, both are removed. Worktree sidecars on both sides are cleaned; file history, subagent transcripts, and runtime sidecars are intentionally preserved.

Request:

```json
{ "sessionIds": ["<uuid>"] }
```

Response:

```json
{
  "removed": ["<uuid>"],
  "notFound": [],
  "errors": []
}
```

### `POST /sessions/archive`

Archive one or more sessions. Archive is a state transition, not deletion: the JSONL moves from `chats/<id>.jsonl` to `chats/archive/<id>.jsonl`. File history, subagent transcripts, and runtime sidecars stay in place. If a session is live, the daemon first performs a strict close and requires the ACP agent's close handler to flush the chat recording; if close or flush fails, the JSONL is not moved. Pre-flight `caps.features.session_archive`.

Request:

```json
{ "sessionIds": ["<uuid>"] }
```

`sessionIds` must be a non-empty string array with at most 100 ids. Duplicates are collapsed.

Response:

```json
{
  "archived": ["<uuid>"],
  "alreadyArchived": [],
  "notFound": [],
  "errors": []
}
```

`errors` entries have `{ "sessionId": "<uuid>", "error": "message" }`. Active and archived files with the same id are treated as a conflict and reported in `errors`; no file is overwritten.

### `POST /sessions/unarchive`

Restore archived sessions to the active directory. This does not resume the session by itself; it only moves `chats/archive/<id>.jsonl` back to `chats/<id>.jsonl`. After unarchive succeeds, clients may call `POST /session/:id/load` or `POST /session/:id/resume`.

Request:

```json
{ "sessionIds": ["<uuid>"] }
```

Response:

```json
{
  "unarchived": ["<uuid>"],
  "alreadyActive": [],
  "notFound": [],
  "errors": []
}
```

If an active JSONL already exists for the id, unarchive reports a conflict in `errors` and does not overwrite it. Archive or unarchive in flight for the same id returns `409 session_archiving` before starting the batch.

ACP-over-HTTP uses the same request and response bodies through vendor methods `_qwen/sessions/archive` and `_qwen/sessions/unarchive`. The REST route table maps `POST /sessions/archive` and `POST /sessions/unarchive` to those methods for ACP transports.

### Multi-workspace live-session routing

When `multi_workspace_sessions` is advertised, live-session operations identify their workspace from the `sessionId`; clients do not add a workspace selector to the URL. In addition to the existing owner-routed lifecycle operations, this applies to `PATCH /session/:id/metadata`, `POST /session/:id/recap`, `POST /session/:id/generate`, `POST /session/:id/btw`, `POST /session/:id/mid-turn-message`, `GET /session/:id/mid-turn-messages`, `DELETE /session/:id/mid-turn-messages/:messageId`, `POST /session/:id/tasks/:taskId/cancel`, `POST /session/:id/goal/clear`, `POST /session/:id/continue`, `POST /session/:id/language`, `POST /session/:id/artifacts`, and `DELETE /session/:id/artifacts/:artifactId`. The daemon routes each request to the trusted runtime that owns the live session. An untrusted non-primary owner returns `403 untrusted_workspace`, a missing live owner returns `404 session_not_found`, and an ambiguous owner fails closed with `500 ambiguous_session_owner`.

This rule is live-session-only and does not make every workspace-less session route multi-workspace-aware. Persisted or archived operations use their documented workspace-qualified routes. `POST /session/:id/branch`, `POST /session/:id/fork`, and `POST /session/:id/cd` intentionally remain primary-only and return `non_primary_session_route_not_supported` for non-primary owners.

### Mid-turn messages

`POST /session/:id/mid-turn-message` accepts `{ "message": "...", "messageId": "<optional-message-id>" }`. A successful admission returns `{ "accepted": true, "messageId": "<id>" }` and transfers ownership to the daemon: the message is drained into the active turn or promoted into the normal prompt FIFO when the session becomes idle. Clients using `session_mid_turn_message_query` send a stable `messageId`; repeating it is idempotent while it remains queued, pending, or in the bounded reconciliation rings. A full queue rejects a new request without taking ownership. New clients connected to an older daemon detect the missing capability and retain their legacy local fallback.

`GET /session/:id/mid-turn-messages` returns the session-wide daemon-owned queue plus bounded `settledMessageIds` and `promotedMessageIds` rings. Settled ids were injected or explicitly deleted; promoted ids entered the normal prompt FIFO. An id in either ring must not be resent.

When a queued message is drained into the active turn, the daemon publishes `mid_turn_message_injected` carrying aligned `messages` and `messageIds` arrays (and the running turn's `promptId` when known). It is a transient dedupe signal, not a transcript item: clients settle completion callbacks registered under those message ids and drop any local pending rows for them. Older daemons additionally carry `originatorClientId` in the payload. A missed echo is recovered from the settled ring via the query above.

When `session_mid_turn_message_mutation` is advertised, an attached session client may call `DELETE /session/:id/mid-turn-messages/:messageId`. It removes the message from either the mid-turn queue or its promoted pending-prompt state; removing a promoted message that is already running aborts that turn, matching ordinary pending-prompt removal. Daemon-owned queue additions and removals publish the existing `pending_prompt_added` and `pending_prompt_completed` session events so attached clients refresh both authoritative queue snapshots. `{ "removed": false }` means the message was already injected, completed, or not found.

### `POST /session/:id/prompt`

Forward a prompt to the agent. Multi-prompt callers FIFO-queue per session (ACP guarantees one active prompt per session).

Request:

```json
{
  "prompt": [{ "type": "text", "text": "What does src/main.ts do?" }],
  "delivery": {
    "kind": "channel",
    "target": {
      "channelName": "dingtalk",
      "type": "user",
      "id": "platform-user-id"
    }
  }
}
```

`delivery` is optional and requires the `channel_delivery` capability. The
daemon still returns `202 {promptId,lastEventId}` when the prompt is admitted.
After a successful `end_turn`, the session submits the visible final text to
the exact workspace's already-running Channel Worker. The payload is only the
last tool-free assistant response block; tool-call preambles, inter-tool
narration, superseded retries, and earlier automatic-continuation blocks are
excluded. An empty or whitespace-only final still produces a correlated
`channel_delivery_result` with `status: "skipped"` after authorization is
consumed, but it does not contact a worker. Delivery success or failure arrives
later through the same replayable event and never changes `turn_complete` into
`turn_error`. Cancellation, Agent failure, and token-limit termination do not
send or publish a delivery result.

Validation: `prompt` must be a non-empty array of objects. Other failures return `400` before reaching the bridge.

Response:

```json
{ "promptId": "session-id########1", "lastEventId": 42 }
```

The `202` response acknowledges admission, not Agent completion. Observe the
session SSE stream after `lastEventId` and correlate `turn_complete` or
`turn_error` by `promptId`. `turn_complete.data.stopReason` may be `end_turn`,
`cancelled`, `max_tokens`, `error`, or `length`.

If the HTTP client disconnects mid-prompt, the daemon sends an ACP `cancel` notification to the agent, which winds the prompt down with `stopReason: "cancelled"`.

When `prompt_absolute_deadline` is advertised, `deadlineMs` may shorten the
configured server deadline. Expiry emits a correlated `turn_error` with
`errorKind: "prompt_deadline_exceeded"`. The deadline releases the caller
without killing the agent; if the agent later settles, turn-status polls for
that `promptId` return the settled transcript outcome instead of the deadline
error.

### `POST /session/:id/cancel`

Cancel the **currently active** prompt on the session. ACP-side this is a notification, not a request — the agent acknowledges by resolving the active `prompt()` with `cancelled`.

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:4170/session/$SID/cancel
# → 204 No Content
```

> **Multi-prompt contract:** cancel only affects the active prompt. Any prompts the same client previously POSTed and are still queued behind the active one will continue to execute. Multi-prompt queueing is a daemon-introduced behavior (not in ACP spec); the contract for queued prompts is "they keep running unless you cancel each, or kill the session via channel exit".

If queued prompts are unexpected in a multi-client deployment, first confirm
whether callers are sharing a default `sessionScope: "single"` session. For
independent per-thread conversations, create sessions with
`sessionScope: "thread"` so prompts serialize only within that thread.

### `DELETE /session/:id`

Explicitly close a live session. Force-closes even when other clients are attached — cancels any active prompt, resolves pending permissions as cancelled, publishes `session_closed` event, closes the EventBus, and removes the session from daemon maps. On-disk persisted sessions are NOT deleted — they can be reloaded via `POST /session/:id/load`. Pre-flight `caps.features.session_close`.

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:4170/session/$SID
# → 204 No Content
```

Idempotent: returns `404` for unknown sessions. The error envelope uses `code: "session_not_found"`; a concurrent close may return `code: "session_closing"`, which clients may treat as the same successful terminal state for this route.

> **`session_closed` event.** SSE subscribers receive a terminal `session_closed` event with `{ sessionId, reason: 'client_close', closedBy?: '<clientId>' }` before the stream ends. SDK reducers treat this identically to `session_died` (sets `alive: false`, clears `pendingPermissions`).

### `PATCH /session/:id/metadata`

Update mutable session metadata. Currently supports `displayName` only. Pre-flight `caps.features.session_metadata`. Grouping and pinning are intentionally not part of this route; use `PATCH /session/:id/organization` under `session_organization`.

Request:

```json
{ "displayName": "My Investigation Session" }
```

| Field         | Required | Notes                                                                          |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `displayName` | no       | String, max 256 characters. Empty string clears the name. Omit to leave as-is. |

Response:

```json
{ "sessionId": "<uuid>", "displayName": "My Investigation Session" }
```

Publishes a `session_metadata_updated` event on the session's SSE stream with `{ sessionId, displayName }`.

### `PATCH /session/:id/organization` and `PATCH /workspaces/:workspace/session/:id/organization`

Update local session organization state through the existing mutation gate. Pre-flight `caps.features.includes('session_organization')`; the plural route additionally requires `workspace_qualified_rest_core`. On the plural route, `:workspace` resolves as an exact registered workspace id first and then as a URL-encoded canonical absolute cwd. The selected runtime must be trusted. Session existence and non-null `groupId` validation are scoped to that runtime's active persisted, archived persisted, and live session state and group store, with no fallback to the primary or another workspace. The legacy route remains primary-workspace-only.

Request:

```json
{ "isPinned": true, "groupId": "018f..." }
```

| Field      | Required | Notes                                                                                                |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `isPinned` | no       | Boolean. `true` sets `pinnedAt` if it was not already pinned; `false` clears `pinnedAt`.             |
| `groupId`  | no       | Custom group id or `null` for ungrouped. Unknown group ids return `404 { code: "group_not_found" }`. |
| `color`    | no       | A supported session color token, or `null` to clear the session color.                               |

Response:

```json
{
  "sessionId": "<uuid>",
  "groupId": "018f...",
  "color": "blue",
  "isPinned": true,
  "pinnedAt": "2026-07-04T12:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-07-04T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

This state is stored in the project-level session organization sidecar under the daemon runtime storage directory. It is not transcript content, does not update transcript `mtime`, is not exported with transcripts, and is preserved across archive/unarchive.

### `POST /session/:id/heartbeat`

Bump the daemon's last-seen bookkeeping for this session. Long-lived adapters (TUI/IDE/web) ping this on an interval so future revocation policy (Wave 5 PR 24) can distinguish dead clients from quiet ones.

Headers:

| Header             | Required | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `X-Qwen-Client-Id` | no       | Echoes the daemon-issued id from `POST /session`. Identified clients also bump their per-client timestamp; anonymous heartbeats only bump the per-session watermark. Must satisfy the same `[A-Za-z0-9._:-]{1,128}` shape as elsewhere. |

Request body is empty (`{}` is fine — no fields are read today).

Response:

```json
{
  "sessionId": "<sid>",
  "clientId": "<cid>",
  "lastSeenAt": 1700000000123
}
```

`clientId` is echoed only when a trusted `X-Qwen-Client-Id` was supplied. `lastSeenAt` is the daemon-side `Date.now()` epoch (ms) the bridge stored.

Errors:

- `400` — `{ code: 'invalid_client_id' }` when the header is malformed (header-shape rule) or when it carries a `clientId` that isn't registered for this session (the bridge throws `InvalidClientIdError` before bumping any timestamp).
- `404` — unknown session.

Capability gating: pre-flight `caps.features.client_heartbeat`. Older daemons return `404` for this path.

### `POST /session/:id/model`

Switch the active model **within** the session's currently bound model service. Serialized through the per-session model-change queue.

(For switching the _service_ itself — Alibaba ModelStudio vs OpenRouter etc — pass `modelServiceId` on `POST /session` for a fresh session. Stage 1 has no live service-switch route.)

Request:

```json
{ "modelId": "qwen-staging" }
```

Response:

```json
{ "modelId": "qwen-staging" }
```

On success, publishes `model_switched` to the SSE stream. On failure, publishes `model_switch_failed` (so passive subscribers see the failure, not just the caller). Races against the agent channel exit so a wedged child can't block the HTTP handler.

### `POST /session/:id/recap`

Capability tag: `session_recap`. Bridge → ACP extMethod `qwen/control/session/recap`.

Generate a one-sentence "where did I leave off" summary of the session. Wraps core's `generateSessionRecap` (`packages/core/src/services/sessionRecap.ts`), which runs a side-query against the fast model with tools disabled, `maxOutputTokens: 300`, and a strict `<recap>...</recap>` output format. The side-query reads the session's existing GeminiClient chat history and does **not** add to it.

Request body is ignored (send `{}` or empty). Non-strict mutation gate — posture mirrors `/session/:id/prompt` (the call costs tokens but mutates no state). No SSE event is published.

Response (200):

```json
{
  "sessionId": "sess:42",
  "recap": "Debugging the auth retry race. Next: add deterministic timing to the integration test."
}
```

`recap` is `null` (a normal 200, not an error) when:

- the session has fewer than two dialog turns yet,
- the side-query returned no extractable `<recap>...</recap>` payload,
- or any underlying model error occurred (the core helper is best-effort and never throws).

Errors:

- `400 {code: 'invalid_client_id'}` — malformed `X-Qwen-Client-Id` header.
- `404` — session unknown.

Cancellation: **none in v1**. The route does not listen for HTTP client disconnect, no `AbortSignal` is plumbed into the bridge, and the ACP child runs the side-query to completion regardless of whether the caller has disconnected. The only ceilings are the bridge's 60s backstop timeout (`SESSION_RECAP_TIMEOUT_MS`) and the transport-closed race against ACP channel death. This is acceptable because recap is short (single-attempt, `maxOutputTokens: 300`, ~1–5s typical); a request-id-based cancel ext-method can plumb full end-to-end cancellation in a future release if the bandwidth cost ever justifies it.

### `POST /session/:id/generate`

Capability tag: `session_generation`.

Run request-scoped text generation from a caller-supplied prompt. The request
does not read or mutate conversation history and exposes no tools. It prefers
the configured fast model, falling back to the session's main model if the fast
model is missing or cannot be resolved. The endpoint is task-agnostic;
translation is only one possible caller-defined prompt.

Request:

```json
{ "prompt": "Translate into Chinese: Hello" }
```

The response is `text/event-stream`. The server writes an initial SSE comment
immediately, followed by `started`, an optional `thinking` progress event, zero
or more `delta` events, and `done`. The `thinking` event carries no reasoning
content. A model failure after streaming starts produces an `error` event; it
does not retry with another model. Prompts are limited to 32 KiB of UTF-8 text.
Disconnecting the HTTP client cancels the generation request.

### Mutation: approval, tools, skills, init, MCP restart

The daemon exposes five mutation control routes that let remote clients change runtime posture without touching the daemon host's CLI. All five:

- Are gated by the **strict** mutation gate from PR 15. A daemon configured without a bearer token rejects them with `401 {code: 'token_required'}`. Configure `--token` (or `QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN`) before opting in.
- Accept and stamp the `X-Qwen-Client-Id` header (PR 7 audit chain). When the header carries a trusted id, the daemon emits `originatorClientId` on the corresponding SSE event so cross-client UIs can suppress echoes of their own mutations.
- Pre-flight each per-tag capability before exposing the affordance. Older daemons return `404` for the route.

The tool toggle, skill toggle, init, and MCP restart routes emit **workspace-scoped** events: every active session SSE bus receives the event, regardless of which session was attached when the mutation was triggered. `approval-mode` emits a **session-scoped** event because the change is local to one session's `Config`.

#### `POST /session/:id/approval-mode`

Capability tag: `session_approval_mode_control`. Bridge → ACP extMethod `qwen/control/session/approval_mode`.

Change the approval mode of a live session. The new mode lands inside the ACP child's per-session `Config` immediately. Settings are NOT written to disk by default — pass `persist: true` to also write `tools.approvalMode` to workspace settings.

Request:

```json
{ "mode": "auto-edit", "persist": false }
```

`mode` must be one of `'plan' | 'default' | 'auto-edit' | 'auto' | 'yolo'` (mirror of core's `ApprovalMode` enum; the SDK exports `DAEMON_APPROVAL_MODES` for runtime validation). `persist` defaults to `false`.

Response (200):

```json
{
  "sessionId": "sess:42",
  "mode": "auto-edit",
  "previous": "default",
  "persisted": false
}
```

Errors:

- `400 {code: 'invalid_approval_mode', allowed: [...]}` — unknown mode literal.
- `400 {code: 'invalid_persist_flag'}` — `persist` is non-boolean.
- `403 {code: 'trust_gate', errorKind: 'auth_env_error'}` — the requested mode requires a trusted folder (privileged modes in untrusted workspaces are rejected by core's `Config.setApprovalMode`).
- `404` — session unknown.

SSE event (session-scoped): `approval_mode_changed` with `{sessionId, previous, next, persisted, originatorClientId?}`.

#### `POST /workspace/tools/:name/enable`

Capability tag: `workspace_tool_toggle`. Pure file IO — no ACP roundtrip.

Toggle a tool name in the workspace's `tools.disabled` settings list. Tools listed there are **not registered** at all (distinct from `permissions.deny`, which keeps the tool registered and rejects invocation). Both built-in tools and MCP-discovered tools flow through `ToolRegistry.registerTool`, which consults the disabled set.

> ⚠️ **Names must match the registry's exposed identifier exactly.** No alias resolution happens — the route stores whatever string is in the path parameter into `tools.disabled`, and the next ACP child compares against `tool.name` at register time. Built-ins use their canonical registry name (snake_case verb form): `run_shell_command`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `list_directory`, `glob`, `grep_search`, `web_fetch`, etc. — NOT the display labels (`Shell`, `Read`, `Write`) that the CLI surfaces. MCP-discovered tools use the qualified `mcp__<server>__<name>` form (which is also the form `tool_toggled` events broadcast and what `GET /workspace/mcp` lists). Disabling `Bash` will NOT prevent `run_shell_command` from registering on the next session.

Live ACP children retain already-registered tools — the toggle takes effect on the **next** ACP child spawn. Combine with `POST /workspace/mcp/:server/restart` (for MCP-sourced tools) or new-session creation to make the change effective in the current daemon.

Unknown tool names are accepted: pre-disabling a not-yet-installed MCP tool is a legitimate use case.

Request:

```json
{ "enabled": false }
```

Response (200):

```json
{ "toolName": "run_shell_command", "enabled": false }
```

Errors:

- `400 {code: 'invalid_tool_name'}` — empty path parameter, or path parameter exceeds the 256-character cap.
- `400 {code: 'invalid_enabled_flag'}` — `enabled` missing or non-boolean.

SSE event (workspace-scoped): `tool_toggled` with `{toolName, enabled, originatorClientId?}`.

#### `POST /workspace/skills/:name/enable`

Capability tag: `workspace_skill_toggle`. The workspace-qualified form is `POST /workspaces/:workspace/skills/:name/enable`.

Toggle a loaded, user-invocable skill through the workspace skill settings, matching the CLI `/skills` panel's Space-key behavior. Lookup is case-insensitive, while persistence and the response use the skill's canonical name. Enabling a `skills.defaultDisabled` skill adds a workspace `skills.enabled` opt-in; disabling removes that opt-in and adds a workspace `skills.disabled` entry. Existing entries for skills that are no longer loaded are preserved, and duplicate/case-variant entries for the target are collapsed. A hard-disable entry inherited from system defaults, user, or system scope locks the skill: workspace scope cannot override it.

This is different from the ACP `qwen/skills/setEnabled` managed-skill operation and the `disable-model-invocation` frontmatter field. Effective skill availability follows `skills.disabled` > `skills.enabled` > `skills.defaultDisabled`. Both hard and default disables remove the skill from slash-command/model availability and reject later skill execution. `disable-model-invocation: true` keeps direct user invocation available and only hides the skill from model invocation.

Request:

```json
{ "enabled": false }
```

Response (200):

```json
{
  "skillName": "review",
  "enabled": false,
  "changed": true,
  "activation": "applied",
  "sessionsRefreshed": 2,
  "sessionsFailed": 0

`activation` is `applied` when every active session refreshed, `deferred` when no ACP child exists (the persisted setting is used when one starts), and `partial` when at least one active session failed to refresh. Busy sessions are included. The daemon reloads workspace settings for the ACP child and every active session, notifies SkillManager consumers, and pushes `available_commands_update`. A request already sent to the model is not rewritten; subsequent validation, command snapshots, and model contexts use the new state. If persistence fails, no refresh or event is emitted. If a session refresh fails, the committed setting is retained. When the child returns per-session results, the session counts are exact. If the refresh control itself fails before returning those results, `sessionsFailed: 1` is a conservative lower bound indicating that the refresh request failed.

Errors:

- `400 {code: 'invalid_skill_name'}` — empty path parameter, or more than 256 characters.
- `400 {code: 'invalid_enabled_flag'}` — `enabled` missing or non-boolean.
- `403 {code: 'untrusted_workspace'}` — the selected workspace is not trusted.
- `404 {code: 'skill_not_found'}` — no loaded skill matches the name.
- `409 {code: 'skill_not_toggleable', reason: 'not_user_invocable' | 'inactive_extension' | 'locked', lockedScope?: 'system' | 'user' | 'systemDefaults'}` — the CLI panel would not allow the target to be toggled. `lockedScope` is present only when `reason` is `locked`.

The mutation reuses the workspace-scoped `settings_changed` event for each changed key (`skills.disabled` and/or `skills.enabled`); it does not add a new event type. Each of those events includes the same `mutation` object: `{ id, kind: 'skill_toggle', skills: [{ name, enabled }], activation, sessionsRefreshed, sessionsFailed }`. `id` correlates every settings event produced by one toggle request. `skills` lists the canonical names and resulting enabled states of Skills that actually changed. Workspace skill status cells include optional `disabledReason: 'hard' | 'default' | 'inactive_extension'` and `lockedScope: 'system' | 'user' | 'systemDefaults'` fields.

#### `POST /workspace/skills/enable`

Capability tag: `workspace_skill_batch_toggle`. The workspace-qualified form is `POST /workspaces/:workspace/skills/enable`.

Toggle up to 100 loaded Skills in one request; the cap counts the raw `skillNames` entries before deduplication. Names are trimmed and deduplicated case-insensitively while preserving first-seen order. The daemon validates against one Skill status snapshot, persists all valid changes in one locked settings write, and refreshes active sessions once. Processing is best-effort for expected target errors: an unknown, hidden, inactive-extension, or locked target is recorded in `errors` without preventing other valid targets from being applied. Unexpected persistence or runtime-generation failures still fail the whole request.

Request:

```json
{
  "skillNames": ["review", "deploy", "missing"],
  "enabled": false
}
```

Response (200):

```json
{
  "enabled": false,
  "activation": "applied",
  "sessionsRefreshed": 2,
  "sessionsFailed": 0,
  "results": [
    {
      "skillName": "review",
      "enabled": false,
      "changed": true
    },
    {
      "skillName": "deploy",
      "enabled": false,
      "changed": true
    }
  ],
  "errors": [
    {
      "skillName": "missing",
      "code": "skill_not_found",
      "error": "Skill not found: missing"
    }
  ]
}
```

Target errors use `skill_not_found`, `skill_not_toggleable`, or `skill_inactive_extension`. Malformed requests return HTTP 400 with `invalid_skill_names`, `invalid_skill_name`, or `invalid_enabled_flag`. Authentication, workspace trust, client identity, unexpected persistence failures, and runtime-generation failures fail the whole request through the standard route gates. Batch-level `activation`, `sessionsRefreshed`, and `sessionsFailed` describe the single live-session refresh shared by all changed results. `activation` reports the refresh attempt rather than the outcome: a batch in which no target changed (for example, every target errored) still answers `applied` when a session is live, matching the single-Skill no-op response, so derive what actually changed from each result's `changed` flag and the `errors` array. When at least one target changes, the daemon emits the same `settings_changed` mutation metadata as the single-Skill route; every `skills.disabled` / `skills.enabled` event from that request shares one `mutation.id`.

#### `POST /workspace/init`

Capability tag: `workspace_init`. Pure file IO — no ACP roundtrip, **no LLM invocation**.

Scaffold an empty `QWEN.md` (or whatever `getCurrentGeminiMdFilename()` returns under `--memory-file-name` overrides) at the daemon's primary workspace root. Mechanical only — for AI-driven content fill, follow up with `POST /session/:id/prompt`.

Default refuses to overwrite when the target file exists with non-whitespace content. Whitespace-only files are treated as absent (matches the local `/init` slash command).

Request:

```json
{ "force": false }
```

Response (200):

```json
{ "path": "/work/bound/QWEN.md", "action": "created" }
```

`action` is `'created'` for fresh creates, `'noop'` when an existing whitespace-only file was left untouched (no write performed), and `'overwrote'` when `force: true` replaced non-empty content. The `workspace_initialized` SSE event mirrors the response action — observers can filter for `action !== 'noop'` to react only to actual on-disk changes.

Errors:

- `400 {code: 'invalid_force_flag'}` — `force` is non-boolean.
- `409 {code: 'workspace_init_conflict', path, existingSize}` — file exists with non-whitespace content and `force` is omitted/false. Body carries the absolute path and size (bytes) so SDK clients can render an "overwrite N bytes?" prompt without re-stat'ing.

SSE event (workspace-scoped): `workspace_initialized` with `{path, action, originatorClientId?}`.

#### `POST /workspace/mcp/reload`

Reload persisted MCP settings into the workspace discovery config and every
active session. The workspace-qualified form is
`POST /workspaces/:workspace/mcp/reload`.

Request body:

```json
{ "forceReconnectAll": true }
```

`forceReconnectAll` is optional and defaults to `false`, preserving
incremental reconciliation. When true, the daemon reconnects every eligible
configured MCP server after the settings reconciliation. Alternatively, pass
`forceReconnectWhich: ["server-a", "server-b"]` to reconnect only named
servers. The options are mutually exclusive. A forced reconnect causes each
transport to read credentials that another local Qwen Code process may have
written to token storage; it does not start an OAuth authorization flow.

The route returns `202 { "accepted": true }`; poll `GET /workspace/mcp` for
the final connection status. Invalid option values return 400.

#### `POST /workspace/mcp/:server/restart`

Capability tag: `workspace_mcp_restart`. Bridge → ACP extMethod `qwen/control/workspace/mcp/restart`.

Restart a configured MCP server through the ACP child's `McpClientManager.discoverMcpToolsForServer` (disconnect + reconnect + rediscover). Pre-checks the live budget snapshot from PR 14 v1's accounting so a restart on a budget-saturated workspace returns a soft refusal rather than triggering a `BudgetExhaustedError` cascade.

Request body is empty (`{}`). The path parameter is the URL-encoded server name as it appears in `mcpServers` config.

Response (200) — discriminated union on `restarted`:

```json
{ "serverName": "docs", "restarted": true, "durationMs": 1234 }
```

```json
{
  "serverName": "docs",
  "restarted": false,
  "skipped": true,
  "reason": "budget_would_exceed"
}
```

Soft skip reasons (all return 200):

| `reason`                | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                               |

| `'in_flight'`           | Another discovery / restart for this server is already in progress. The route returns immediately rather than awaiting the original promise. Caller should retry after a short delay. |
| `'disabled'`            | Server is configured but listed in `excludedMcpServers`. Re-enable before restart.                                                                                                    |
| `'budget_would_exceed'` | Daemon is `--mcp-budget-mode=enforce`, the target server is not currently in `reservedSlots`, and the live total has reached `clientBudget`. Caller should free a slot first.         |

Errors (non-2xx):

- `400 {code: 'invalid_server_name'}` — empty path parameter.
- `404` — server name not in `mcpServers` config, or no live ACP channel exists (restart inherently requires a live `McpClientManager` instance).
- `500` — internal error (e.g. `ToolRegistry` not initialized).

SSE events (workspace-scoped): `mcp_server_restarted` with `{serverName, durationMs, originatorClientId?}` on success; `mcp_server_restart_refused` with `{serverName, reason, originatorClientId?}` on soft skip.

| `maxQueued`        | no       | Per-subscriber **live frame backlog** cap. Range `[16, 2048]`, default 256. Replay frames force-pushed at subscribe time are exempt from the frame and byte caps; what actually consumes them is live events that arrive while the subscriber is still draining a large `Last-Event-ID: 0` replay. Bump for cold reconnects so the live tail doesn't trip the slow-client warning / eviction before the consumer catches up. The live serialized-byte cap is fixed daemon-side (default 2 MiB) and has no query parameter.

A successful handshake includes `X-Qwen-SSE-Stream-Id: <uuid>`. Browser gateways must preserve that response header and expose it through `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`. Old daemons or intermediaries may omit it; clients must continue normally and treat lineage as unavailable. The id identifies this physical REST/SSE connection and correlates its daemon lifecycle, queue diagnostics, and request trace.

Frame format. The `data:` line is the **full event envelope**, JSON-stringified on a single line — `{id?, v, type, data, originatorClientId?}`. The ACP-specific payload (`sessionUpdate`, `requestPermission` arguments, etc.) sits under the envelope's `data` field; the envelope's own `type` matches the SSE `event:` line.

```
id: 7
event: session_update
data: {"id":7,"v":1,"type":"session_update","data":{"sessionUpdate":"agent_message_chunk","content":{"type":"text","text":"…"}}}

id: 8
event: permission_request
data: {"id":8,"v":1,"type":"permission_request","data":{"requestId":"<uuid>","sessionId":"<sid>","toolCall":{...},"options":[...]}}

: heartbeat              ← every 15s, no payload

event: client_evicted    ← terminal frame, no id (synthetic)
data: {"v":1,"type":"client_evicted","data":{"reason":"queue_overflow","droppedAfter":42,"queueSize":256,"maxQueued":256,"queuedBytes":1800000,"maxQueuedBytes":2097152}}

event: client_evicted    ← terminal frame for byte overflow, no id (synthetic)
data: {"v":1,"type":"client_evicted","data":{"reason":"queue_bytes_overflow","droppedAfter":43,"queueSize":1,"maxQueued":256,"queuedBytes":1900000,"maxQueuedBytes":2097152,"eventBytes":300000}}
```

The SSE-level `id:` / `event:` lines duplicate `envelope.id` / `envelope.type` for EventSource compatibility. Raw-`fetch` consumers (the SDK's `parseSseStream`) read everything off the JSON envelope and ignore the SSE preamble lines.

Reconnect semantics:

- Send `Last-Event-ID: <n>` to replay events with `id > n` from the per-session ring (default depth **8000**, tunable via `qwen serve --event-ring-size <n>`).
- **Gap detection:** if `<n>` predates the oldest event still in the ring, the daemon emits an id-less `state_resync_required` frame before replaying the surviving suffix. The SDK latches `awaitingResync`; clients should call `POST /session/:id/load` and rebuild from the current bounded replay snapshot window. That snapshot may itself start with `history_truncated` when older in-memory replay entries were dropped; this marker is informational and must not start another resync loop.
- IDs are monotonic per session, starting at 1
- Synthetic frames (`client_evicted`, `slow_client_warning`, `stream_error`) intentionally omit `id` so they don't burn a sequence slot for other subscribers

Backpressure:

- Per-subscriber queue defaults to `maxQueued: 256` live items plus a daemon-owned 2 MiB live serialized-byte cap. Replay frames during reconnect, `slow_client_warning`, and `client_evicted` bypass both caps.
- Override only the frame cap via `?maxQueued=N` (range `[16, 2048]`) on the SSE request. There is deliberately no `?maxQueuedBytes`; clients cannot raise daemon memory budget.
- When a subscriber's live frame backlog or live byte backlog crosses 75% full the bus force-pushes a `slow_client_warning` synthetic frame to that subscriber (once per overflow episode; re-armed after both measurements drain below 37.5%). The stream stays open — the warning is a heads-up so the client can drain faster or detach + reconnect cleanly.
- If the live frame cap overflows, the bus emits `client_evicted` with `reason: "queue_overflow"`. If the live byte cap overflows, it emits `reason: "queue_bytes_overflow"`. In both cases the terminal frame is force-pushed and the subscription closes.

### `POST /permission/:requestId`

Cast a vote on a pending `permission_request`. The active **mediation policy** decides who wins:

| Policy                      | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `first-responder` (default) | Any validated voter wins; later voters get `404`. Pre-F3 baseline.                                                                                                                                    |
| `designated`                | Only the prompt originator (`originatorClientId`) decides; non-originators get `403 permission_forbidden / designated_mismatch`. Falls back to first-responder for anonymous prompts.                 |
| `consensus`                 | N-of-M voters must agree (default `N = floor(M/2) + 1`, override via `policy.consensusQuorum`). First option to reach `N` wins. Non-resolving votes get `200` + `permission_partial_vote` SSE frames. |
| `local-only`                | Only loopback voters decide; remote callers get `403 permission_forbidden / remote_not_allowed`.                                                                                                      |

The active policy is configured in `settings.json` under `policy.permissionStrategy` and surfaced on `/capabilities` at `body.policy.permission`. Pre-flight `caps.features.permission_mediation` (with `modes: [...]`) for the build-supported set.

> **F3 (#4175): multi-client permission coordination.** F3 added the four policies above. Pre-F3 daemons hardcoded first-responder; the wire shape stays bit-for-bit unchanged when the configured policy is `first-responder`. New events (`permission_partial_vote`, `permission_forbidden`) are additive — old SDKs see them as `unrecognized_known_event` and gracefully ignore.

> **Permission timeout (default 5 minutes).** A `permission_request`
> stays pending until: (a) some client votes here, (b) `POST /session/:id/cancel`
> fires, (c) the HTTP client driving the prompt disconnects
> (mid-prompt cancel resolves outstanding permissions as `cancelled`),

Request:

```json
{
  "outcome": {
    "outcome": "selected",
    "optionId": "proceed_once"
  }
}
```

Outcomes:

- `{ "outcome": "selected", "optionId": "<one-of-the-options>" }` — accept / reject / proceed-once / etc, per the agent's offered choices
- `{ "outcome": "cancelled" }` — drop the request (matches what `cancelSession` / `shutdown` do internally)

Response:

- `200 {}` — your vote was accepted (resolved OR recorded under consensus quorum)
- `403 { "code": "permission_forbidden", "reason": "designated_mismatch" | "remote_not_allowed", "requestId", "sessionId" }` — F3: the active policy rejected your vote
- `404 { "error": "..." }` — the requestId is unknown (already resolved, never existed, or session torn down)
- `500 { "code": "cancel_sentinel_collision", ... }` — F3: the agent's `allowedOptionIds` contains the reserved sentinel `'__cancelled__'`; agent / daemon contract violation
- `501 { "code": "permission_policy_not_implemented", "policy": "<name>" }` — F3 forward-compat: a policy literal landed in the schema but its mediator branch isn't built yet (currently unreachable; reserved for future policies)

After a successful vote, every connected client sees `permission_resolved` with the same `requestId` and the chosen `outcome`. Under `consensus`, intermediate votes additionally fan out `permission_partial_vote` until quorum.

### Auth device-flow routes (issue #4175 PR 21)

The daemon brokers an OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant (RFC 8628) so a remote SDK client can trigger a login whose tokens land on the **daemon** filesystem — not on the client. The daemon polls the IdP itself; the client's only job is to display the verification URL + user code and (optionally) subscribe to SSE for completion events.

Capability tag: `auth_device_flow` (always advertised). Supported providers in
v1: `qwen-oauth`.

> [!note]
>
> Qwen OAuth free tier was discontinued on 2026-04-15. Treat `qwen-oauth` as the
> legacy v1 provider identifier in this protocol; new clients should prefer a
> currently supported auth provider when one is available.

**Runtime locality.** The daemon never spawns a browser — even if it can. The client decides whether to call `open(verificationUri)` locally; on a headless pod (the canonical Mode B deployment) the user opens the URL on whatever device they have a browser on. See `docs/users/qwen-serve.md` for the recommended UX.

**No token leakage in events.** `auth_device_flow_started` carries `{deviceFlowId, providerId, expiresAt}` only. The user code and verification URL come back point-to-point in the POST 201 body and via `GET /workspace/auth/device-flow/:id`; they are never broadcast on SSE.

**Per-provider singleton.** A second `POST` for the same provider while a flow is pending is an idempotent take-over — it returns the existing entry with `attached: true` rather than starting a fresh IdP request.

#### `POST /workspace/auth/device-flow`

Strict mutation gate: requires a bearer token even on token-less loopback defaults (`401 token_required`).

Request:

```json
{ "providerId": "qwen-oauth" }
```

Response (`201` fresh start, `200` idempotent take-over):

```json
{
  "deviceFlowId": "fa07c61b-…",
  "providerId": "qwen-oauth",
  "status": "pending",
  "userCode": "USER-1",
  "verificationUri": "https://chat.qwen.ai/api/v1/oauth2/device",
  "verificationUriComplete": "https://chat.qwen.ai/api/v1/oauth2/device?user_code=USER-1",
  "expiresAt": 1700000600000,
  "intervalMs": 5000,
  "attached": false
}
```

Errors:

- `400 unsupported_provider` — unknown `providerId` (response includes `supportedProviders`)
- `409 too_many_active_flows` — workspace cap (4) reached; cancel one with `DELETE`
- `401 token_required` — strict gate denied a token-less request
- `502 upstream_error` — IdP returned an unexpected error

#### `GET /workspace/auth/device-flow/:id`

Read the current state. Pending entries echo `userCode/verificationUri/expiresAt/intervalMs`; terminal entries (5-min grace) drop them and surface `status` + optional `errorKind/hint`.

Returns `404 device_flow_not_found` for unknown ids and post-grace evicted entries.

#### `DELETE /workspace/auth/device-flow/:id`

Idempotent cancel:

- pending entry → `204` + emit `auth_device_flow_cancelled`
- terminal entry → `204` no-op (no event re-emit)
- unknown id → `404`

#### `GET /workspace/auth/status`

Snapshot of pending flows + supported providers:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "workspaceCwd": "/work/bound",
  "providers": [],
  "pendingDeviceFlows": [
    {
      "deviceFlowId": "fa07c61b-…",
      "providerId": "qwen-oauth",
      "expiresAt": 1700000600000
    }
  ],
  "supportedDeviceFlowProviders": ["qwen-oauth"]
}
```

#### Device-flow SSE events

Five typed events (workspace-scoped, fanned out to every active session bus):

- `auth_device_flow_started` `{deviceFlowId, providerId, expiresAt}` — POST succeeded; SDK should subscribe (no userCode here, fetch via GET if needed)
- `auth_device_flow_throttled` `{deviceFlowId, intervalMs}` — daemon honored upstream `slow_down`; clients polling GET should bump their interval to match
- `auth_device_flow_authorized` `{deviceFlowId, providerId, expiresAt?, accountAlias?}` — credentials persisted; `accountAlias` is a non-PII label (never email/phone)
- `auth_device_flow_failed` `{deviceFlowId, errorKind, hint?}` — terminal; `errorKind` is one of `expired_token | access_denied | invalid_grant | upstream_error | persist_failed`. `persist_failed` is daemon-internal: the IdP exchange succeeded but the daemon couldn't durably store credentials (EACCES / EROFS / ENOSPC). The user should retry once the underlying disk condition is fixed.
- `auth_device_flow_cancelled` `{deviceFlowId}` — DELETE succeeded against a pending entry

> **Not MCP-compatible.** The MCP authorization spec (2025-06-18) mandates OAuth 2.1 + PKCE auth-code with a redirect callback, which doesn't work for headless-pod daemons. Mode B's device-flow surface is daemon-private — clients targeting MCP-compliant servers should use a different auth path.

## Streaming wire format

Events are emitted as standard EventSource frames. The daemon writes one `data:` line per frame (the JSON has no embedded newlines after `JSON.stringify`); the SDK parser at `packages/sdk-typescript/src/daemon/sse.ts` handles both that and the spec-allowed multi-`data:` form on the receive side.

## Error frames during streaming

If the bridge iterator throws while serving an SSE subscriber, the daemon emits a terminal `stream_error` frame (no `id`). The `data:` line is the full envelope (same shape as every other SSE frame in this doc); the actual error message lives under `envelope.data.error`:

```
event: stream_error
data: {"v":1,"type":"stream_error","data":{"error":"<message>"}}
```

The connection then closes.
