# Subagents

Subagents are specialized AI assistants that handle specific types of tasks within Qwen Code. They allow you to delegate focused work to AI agents that are configured with task-specific prompts, tools, and behaviors.

## What are Subagents?

Subagents are independent AI assistants that:

- **Specialize in specific tasks** - Each Subagent is configured with a focused system prompt for particular types of work
- **Have separate context** - They maintain their own conversation history, separate from your main chat
- **Use controlled tools** - You can configure which tools each Subagent has access to
- **Work autonomously** - Once given a task, they work independently until completion or failure
- **Provide detailed feedback** - You can see their progress, tool usage, and execution statistics in real-time

## Fork Subagent

In addition to named subagents, Qwen Code supports **forking** — selected explicitly with `subagent_type: "fork"`. A fork inherits the parent's full conversation context and normally runs detached in the background. Forks work in both interactive and headless sessions; headless forks always use the background path. Omitting `subagent_type` does **not** fork; it launches the general-purpose subagent. Top-level named subagents run in the background by default and deliver their results through completion notifications. Set `run_in_background: false` when the current turn must wait for a regular subagent's result inline.

## Fork Context with `fork_turns`

Only `subagent_type: "fork"` accepts `fork_turns`:

- Omitting it or using `all` inherits the full parent conversation.
- A positive integer string such as `"3"` inherits the most recent three real user turns.

Tool responses and pure system reminders do not count as user turns. Regular named subagents and agent-team teammates do not accept `fork_turns`; they keep their separate conversation context.

## Restricting Fork Tool Execution with `fork_tools`

Only `subagent_type: "fork"` accepts `fork_tools`. The array may contain exact canonical tool names, such as `read_file` and `grep_search`, or MCP server patterns such as `mcp__github`. The fork still receives the same model-visible tool declarations as an unrestricted fork, preserving its prompt-cache prefix, but its task prompt identifies the restriction and a call not matched by `fork_tools` is rejected before scheduling or approval.

- Forks never execute `ask_user_question`; when user input is required, they report the blocker to their parent agent.
- Omitting `fork_tools` allows every other inherited tool.
- An empty array rejects every tool call.
- `*` is not accepted; omit `fork_tools` to allow every otherwise-executable inherited tool.
- Tool names cannot have surrounding whitespace. Wildcards are accepted only as `mcp__*` or as a trailing MCP tool-prefix pattern such as `mcp__github__read_*`.
- `mcp__*` intentionally allows every MCP tool while still denying unlisted built-in tools.
- Shell command argument patterns are not supported. Listing `run_shell_command` allows that tool to proceed through its normal permission checks but does not pre-approve any command.

This is a per-invocation restriction supplied by the caller. It narrows a child fork's capabilities but is not an administrator-enforced security sandbox because the caller can omit or expand the list.

## Reusing Fork Restrictions with `fork_profile`

A project can save a named fork restriction in `.qwen/fork-profiles/<name>.md` and select it with `fork_profile`. This is useful when several calls need the same tool boundary and task guidance:

```markdown
---
name: ro-research
tools:
  - read_file
  - grep_search
  - glob
  - mcp__search__*
promptHint: |
  Work read-only. Prefer targeted searches and cite file evidence.
---
```

Then launch the fork with:

```text
agent(description="Research", prompt="Inspect the retry path", subagent_type="fork", fork_profile="ro-research")
```

- `fork_profile` is valid only for a fork and cannot be combined with `fork_tools` or a named teammate.
- Profiles are currently project-only. The requested name, filename, and frontmatter `name` must match exactly. The profile must resolve to a regular file inside `.qwen/fork-profiles/` and cannot exceed 64 KiB.
- `tools` is required and follows the `fork_tools` rules, including empty-array deny-all behavior.
- `promptHint` is optional and limited to 200 characters. It is escaped and framed as project-supplied guidance after the fork directive and before the authoritative tool restriction; it does not change the inherited system instruction or model-visible tool declarations. Profile files are frontmatter-only, so non-blank Markdown after the closing `---` is rejected instead of silently ignored.
- The profile is resolved once at launch. A retained fork continues with the resolved tool snapshot even if the project file later changes.
- Project fork profiles are unavailable in safe mode and bare mode, which disable local customizations.

Like `fork_tools`, a fork profile is a caller-selected restriction rather than an administrator sandbox. Its optional prompt guidance is project-controlled content.

### How Fork Differs from Named Subagents

|               | Named Subagent                                                 | Fork Subagent                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Context       | Starts fresh with no parent conversation history               | Inherits all parent history by default; `fork_turns` can select a bounded recent window                                                                                                              |
| System prompt | Uses its own configured prompt                                 | Uses parent's exact system prompt (for cache sharing)                                                                                                                                                |
| Tools         | Configured declaration set without interactive question tools  | Keeps the parent-derived declaration set for caching; execution always rejects `ask_user_question`, and `fork_tools` or `fork_profile` can independently narrow it without changing that declaration |
| Execution     | Background by default; supports an explicit foreground opt-out | Always detached; parent continues immediately                                                                                                                                                        |
| Use case      | Specialized tasks (testing, docs)                              | Parallel tasks that need the current context                                                                                                                                                         |

### When Fork is Used

The AI automatically uses fork when it needs to:

- Run multiple research tasks in parallel (e.g., "investigate module A, B, and C")
- Perform background work while continuing the main conversation
- Delegate tasks that require understanding of the current conversation context

### Prompt Cache Sharing

All forks share the parent's exact API request prefix (system prompt, tools, conversation history), enabling DashScope prompt cache hits. When 3 forks run in parallel, the shared prefix is cached once and reused — saving 80%+ token costs compared to independent subagents.

### Recursive Delegation Prevention

Fork children cannot spawn any further sub-agent. This is enforced at runtime — if a fork calls the Agent tool, it receives an error instructing it to execute tasks directly.

### Current Limitation

- **No worktree isolation**: Forks share the parent's working directory. Concurrent file modifications from multiple forks may conflict.

## Key Benefits

- **Task Specialization**: Create agents optimized for specific workflows (testing, documentation, refactoring, etc.)
- **Context Isolation**: Keep specialized work separate from your main conversation
- **Context Inheritance**: Fork subagents inherit the full conversation by default and can select a bounded number of recent parent turns
- **Prompt Cache Sharing**: Fork subagents share the parent's cache prefix, reducing token costs
- **Reusability**: Save and reuse agent configurations across projects and sessions
- **Controlled Access**: Limit which tools each agent can use for security and focus
- **Progress Visibility**: Monitor agent execution with real-time progress updates

## How Subagents Work

1. **Configuration**: You create Subagents configurations that define their behavior, tools, and system prompts
2. **Delegation**: The main AI can automatically delegate tasks to appropriate Subagents — or fork itself (`subagent_type: "fork"`) when it needs the parent conversation context
3. **Execution**: Subagents work independently, using their configured tools to complete tasks
4. **Results**: Background runs send a completion notification containing the result to the main conversation; foreground regular subagents return results inline
5. **Continuation**: The main AI can use `list_agents` to find background agents and `send_message` to continue a running, paused, or completed agent

## Background Agent Continuation

Top-level regular subagents run in the background by default. After a background agent finishes, Qwen Code keeps enough state to continue related work without launching a duplicate agent:

- `list_agents` returns the addressable background agents in the current session, including compatible agents restored with a resumed session. Each entry includes a `task_id`, status, and whether it can receive a message.
- `send_message` with that `task_id` queues a message for a running agent, resumes a paused agent, or continues a completed agent. Completed agents reuse their resident runtime when available and otherwise revive from their retained transcript.
- A continued agent reports its next result through another completion notification.

When a session is restored, compatible background agents are added back to the session roster. A task can be visible but not continuable when its retained state is missing or incompatible; `list_agents` reports the reason in that case.

Use continuation for related follow-up work. Launch a new agent when the task is unrelated or the previous agent cannot be resumed.

## Agent Working Directory

For a named regular subagent, `working_dir` pins the agent to an existing git worktree of the current repository. Relative paths resolve from the current directory, and the worktree must already be registered with git as a linked worktree of this repository.

A `working_dir` launch runs in the foreground because Qwen Code does not own that worktree's lifecycle. It cannot be combined with `subagent_type: "fork"` or background execution. If both `working_dir` and `isolation: "worktree"` are supplied, Qwen Code reuses the caller-owned worktree instead of creating another one. Workflow scripts are deliberately stricter: a workflow `agent()` call that receives both `workingDir` and `isolation` is rejected rather than run with `isolation` ignored.

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

1. **Create your first Subagent**:

   `/agents create`

   Follow the guided wizard to create a specialized agent.

2. **Manage existing agents**:

   `/agents manage`

   View and manage your configured Subagents.

3. **Use Subagents automatically**: Simply ask the main AI to perform tasks that match your Subagents' specializations. The AI will automatically delegate appropriate work.

### Example Usage

```
User: "Please write comprehensive tests for the authentication module"
AI: I'll delegate this to your testing specialist Subagents.
[Delegates to "testing-expert" Subagents]
[Shows real-time progress of test creation]
[Returns with completed test files and execution summary]`
```

## Management

### CLI Commands

Subagents are managed through the `/agents` slash command and its subcommands:

**Usage:**：`/agents create`。Creates a new Subagent through a guided step wizard.

**Usage:**：`/agents manage`。Opens an interactive management dialog for viewing and managing existing Subagents.

### Storage Locations

Subagents are stored as Markdown files in multiple locations:

- **Project-level**: `.qwen/agents/` (highest precedence)
- **User-level**: `~/.qwen/agents/` (fallback)
- **Extension-level**: Provided by installed extensions

This allows you to have project-specific agents, personal agents that work across all projects, and extension-provided agents that add specialized capabilities.

### Extension Subagents

Extensions can provide custom subagents that become available when the extension is enabled. These agents are stored in the extension's `agents/` directory and follow the same format as personal and project agents.

Extension subagents:

- Are automatically discovered when the extension is enabled
- Appear in the `/agents manage` dialog under "Extension Agents" section
- Cannot be edited directly (edit the extension source instead)
- Follow the same configuration format as user-defined agents

To see which extensions provide subagents, check the extension's `qwen-extension.json` file for an `agents` field.

### File Format

Subagents are configured using Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. This format is human-readable and easy to edit with any text editor.

#### Basic Structure

```
---
name: agent-name
description: Brief description of when and how to use this agent
model: inherit # Optional: inherit, fast, modelId, or authType:modelId
approvalMode: auto-edit # Optional: default, plan, auto-edit, yolo, bubble
tools:         # Optional: allowlist of tools
  - tool1
  - tool2
disallowedTools: # Optional: blocklist of tools
  - tool3
---

System prompt content goes here.
Multiple paragraphs are supported.
```

#### Model Selection

Use the optional `model` frontmatter field to control which model a subagent uses:

- `inherit`: Use the same model as the main conversation.
- Omit the field: Same as `inherit`.
- `fast`: Use the configured `fastModel`. If no valid fast model is configured,
  the subagent falls back to `inherit`.
- `glm-5`: Use that model ID. Qwen Code first checks the main conversation's
  auth type; if the model is not available there, it can resolve the model from
  another configured provider.
- `openai:gpt-4o`: Use an explicit provider and model ID. This is useful when a
  subagent should run on a model registered under a different auth type from the
  main conversation.

For example:

```
---
name: fast-reviewer
description: Reviews small diffs with the configured fast model
model: fast
tools:
  - read_file
  - grep_search
---
```

```
---
name: openai-researcher
description: Uses an OpenAI-compatible provider for research tasks
model: openai:gpt-4o
tools:
  - read_file
  - grep_search
  - glob
---
```

The `fast` selector uses the same `fastModel` setting configured in
`settings.json` or with `/model --fast`. That setting may itself refer to a
model under another configured auth type, such as `openai:deepseek-v4-flash`.
When the selector resolves to another auth type, Qwen Code creates a dedicated
runtime provider for that subagent request and sends the provider only the bare
model ID.

The built-in Explore agent inherits the main session model by default. To
select a different model for only that built-in agent, configure
`agents.builtin.exploreModel` in `settings.json` and restart Qwen Code:

Earlier versions used `fastModel` for Explore by default. To preserve that
behavior, set `agents.builtin.exploreModel` to `fast`.

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "builtin": {
      "exploreModel": "fast"
    }
  }
}
```

This setting accepts the same selectors described above. It is applied only
when Qwen Code resolves the built-in Explore definition; a session, project,
user, or extension agent named Explore keeps its own `model` setting.

To let the model select from user-defined grades without exposing concrete
model IDs, configure `agents.modelGrades` and optionally restrict them with
`agents.allowedGrades`:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "modelGrades": {
      "small": "fast",
      "high": "qwen-max"
    },
    "allowedGrades": ["small", "high"]
  }
}
```

The Agent tool then accepts `model: "small"` or `model: "high"` for regular
subagents. Unknown, disallowed, fork, and named-teammate grade selections are
rejected. A custom agent's explicit model still takes precedence over a grade.

#### Permission Mode

Use the optional `approvalMode` frontmatter field to control how a subagent's tool calls are approved. Valid values:

- `default`: Tools require interactive approval (same as the main session default)
- `plan`: Analyze-only mode — the agent plans but does not execute changes
- `auto-edit`: Tools are auto-approved without prompting (recommended for most agents)
- `yolo`: All tools auto-approved, including potentially destructive ones
- `bubble`: Background-agent tool approvals are surfaced in the parent session

If you omit this field, the subagent's permission mode is determined automatically:

- If the parent session is in **yolo** or **auto-edit** mode, the subagent inherits that mode. A permissive parent stays permissive.
- If the parent session is in **plan** mode, the subagent stays in plan mode. An analyze-only session cannot mutate files through a delegated agent.
- If the parent session is in **default** mode (in a trusted folder), the subagent gets **auto-edit** so it can work autonomously.

When you do set `approvalMode`, the parent's permissive modes still take priority. For example, if the parent is in yolo mode, a subagent with `approvalMode: plan` will still run in yolo mode.

```

approvalMode: plan
tools:
  - read_file
  - grep_search
  - glob
---

You are a code reviewer. Analyze the code and report findings.
Do not modify any files.
```

#### Tool Configuration

Use `tools` and `disallowedTools` to control which tools a subagent can access.

**`tools` (allowlist):** When specified, the subagent can only use the listed tools. When omitted, the subagent inherits all available tools from the parent session.

```
---
name: reader
description: Read-only agent for code exploration
tools:
  - read_file
  - grep_search
  - glob
  - list_directory
---
```

**`disallowedTools` (blocklist):** When specified, the listed tools are removed from the subagent's tool pool. This is useful when you want "everything except X" without listing every permitted tool.

```
---
name: safe-worker
description: Agent that cannot modify files
disallowedTools:
  - write_file
  - edit
  - run_shell_command
---
```

If both `tools` and `disallowedTools` are set, the allowlist is applied first, then the blocklist removes from that set.

**MCP tools** follow the same rules. If a subagent has no `tools` list, it inherits all MCP tools from the parent session. If a subagent has an explicit `tools` list, it only gets MCP tools that are explicitly named in that list.

The `disallowedTools` field supports MCP server-level patterns:

- `mcp__server__tool_name` — blocks a specific MCP tool
- `mcp__server` — blocks all tools from that MCP server

```
---
name: no-slack
description: Agent without Slack access
disallowedTools:
  - mcp__slack
---
```

#### Claude Code Compatibility Fields

Qwen Code accepts the Claude Code 2.1.168 frontmatter fields below so you
can drop a CC agent file into `.qwen/agents/` and have the supported fields
parse identically. Optional fields with invalid values are silently dropped
at parse time rather than rejected — the same lenient posture CC uses.

| Field            | Type             | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `permissionMode` | enum string      | `acceptEdits`, `auto`, `bypassPermissions`, `default`, `dontAsk`, `plan`. Mapped to `approvalMode` at parse time; when both are set, the explicit `approvalMode` wins.                                                                                                           |
| `maxTurns`       | positive integer | Caps the agent's turn budget. Wired into `runConfig.max_turns` at runtime; when both are set, the top-level field wins. The legacy nested value is pruned from the on-disk file on save to avoid two sources of truth.                                                           |
| `color`          | enum string      | Display color. Allowlist: `red`, `blue`, `green`, `yellow`, `purple`, `orange`, `pink`, `cyan` (mirrors CC's `_Y`). The legacy qwen sentinel `auto` is preserved for backward compatibility. Other values are silently dropped on parse.                                         |
| `mcpServers`     | record of specs  | Per-agent MCP server overrides. Merged with the session-level MCP server set when the agent spawns; on key collision the agent's spec wins (matching CC's `scope: 'agent'` semantics). Malformed entries are dropped per-key with a warning rather than failing the whole agent. |
| `hooks`          | record of arrays | Per-agent hooks. Keys are CC hook event names (`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `UserPromptSubmit`, …); values are arrays of `{ matcher?, hooks: [...] }` definitions in the same shape as `settings.json`'s `hooks` field. Registered while the agent runs, removed when it stops.  |

Example with all of the above:

```
---
name: rigorous-reviewer
description: Deep code review with a turn cap
permissionMode: plan
maxTurns: 50
color: cyan
tools:
  - read_file
  - grep_search
  - glob
mcpServers:
  filesystem:
    type: stdio
    command: node
    args: [/usr/local/lib/mcp-fs/server.js]
hooks:
  PreToolUse:
    - matcher: Bash
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: echo "review-agent about to run a shell command"
---

You are a code reviewer. Analyze the code thoroughly and report findings
ordered by severity.
```

The remaining CC frontmatter fields — `effort`, `skills`, `initialPrompt`,
`memory`, `isolation` — are documented in the declarative-agent design doc
and land in follow-up PRs once the prerequisite infrastructure exists
(`effort` needs a model-layer parameter; `memory` needs a scoped memory
subsystem; `--agent` CLI flag enables `initialPrompt`; etc.).

> **`hooks` v1 limitation.** While a subagent declaring `hooks` is running,
> its hook entries fire for every matching event in the session, not only
> for that subagent's own tool calls. If two subagents with different
> per-agent hook sets run concurrently, both sets fire for both agents.
> Per-agent scope filtering at hook-firing time is left to a follow-up;
> for v1, prefer per-agent hooks that are safe to fire globally for the
> duration of the agent's run (e.g. logging) over hooks that mutate
> behavior.

## Using Subagents Effectively

### Automatic Delegation

Qwen Code proactively delegates tasks based on:

- The task description in your request
- The description field in Subagents configurations
- Current context and available tools

To encourage more proactive Subagents use, include phrases like "use PROACTIVELY" or "MUST BE USED" in your description field.

### Explicit Invocation

Request a specific Subagent by mentioning it in your command:

```
Let the testing-expert Subagents create unit tests for the payment module
Have the documentation-writer Subagents update the API reference
Get the react-specialist Subagents to optimize this component's performance
```

You are a React specialist with deep expertise in modern React development.

Your expertise covers:

- **Component Design**: Functional components, custom hooks, composition patterns
- **State Management**: useState, useReducer, Context API, and external libraries
- **Performance**: React.memo, useMemo, useCallback, code splitting
- **Testing**: React Testing Library, Jest, component testing strategies
- **TypeScript Integration**: Proper typing for props, hooks, and components
- **Modern Patterns**: Suspense, Error Boundaries, Concurrent Features

For React tasks:

1. Use functional components and hooks by default
2. Implement proper TypeScript typing
3. Follow React best practices and conventions
4. Consider performance implications
5. Include appropriate error handling
6. Write testable, maintainable code

## Best Practices

### Design Principles

#### Single Responsibility Principle

Each Subagent should have a clear, focused purpose.

**✅ Good:**

```
---
name: testing-expert
description: Writes comprehensive unit tests and integration tests
---
```

**❌ Avoid:**

```
---
name: general-helper
description: Helps with testing, documentation, code review, and deployment
---
```

**Why:** Focused agents produce better results and are easier to maintain.

#### Clear Specialization

Define specific expertise areas rather than broad capabilities.

**✅ Good:**

```
---
name: react-performance-optimizer
description: Optimizes React applications for performance using profiling and best practices
---
```

**❌ Avoid:**

```
---
name: frontend-developer
description: Works on frontend development tasks
---
```

**Why:** Specific expertise leads to more targeted and effective assistance.

#### Actionable Descriptions

Write descriptions that clearly indicate when to use the agent.

**✅ Good:**

```
description: Reviews code for security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and maintainability concerns
```

**❌ Avoid:**

```
description: A helpful code reviewer
```

**Why:** Clear descriptions help the main AI choose the right agent for each task.

### Configuration Best Practices

#### System Prompt Guidelines

**Be Specific About Expertise:**

```
You are a Python testing specialist with expertise in:

- pytest framework and fixtures
- Mock objects and dependency injection
- Test-driven development practices
- Performance testing with pytest-benchmark
```

**Include Step-by-Step Approaches:**

```
For each testing task:

1. Analyze the code structure and dependencies
2. Identify key functionality and edge cases
3. Create comprehensive test suites with clear naming
4. Include setup/teardown and proper assertions
5. Add comments explaining complex test scenarios
```

**Specify Output Standards:**

```
Always follow these standards:

- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Add docstrings for complex test functions
- Ensure tests are independent and can run in any order
```

## Security Considerations

- **Tool Restrictions**: Use `tools` to limit which tools a subagent can access, or `disallowedTools` to block specific tools while inheriting everything else
- **Permission Mode**: Subagents inherit their parent's permission mode by default. Plan-mode sessions cannot escalate to auto-edit through delegated agents. Privileged modes (auto-edit, yolo) are blocked in untrusted folders.
- **Provider Selection**: A subagent with `model: authType:modelId`, or
  `model: fast` where `fastModel` resolves to another auth type, sends that
  subagent's model requests to the selected provider. Make sure that provider is
  appropriate for the subagent's task and data.
- **Sandboxing**: All tool execution follows the same security model as direct tool use
- **Audit Trail**: All Subagents actions are logged and visible in real-time
- **Access Control**: Project and user-level separation provides appropriate boundaries
- **Sensitive Information**: Avoid including secrets or credentials in agent configurations
- **Production Environments**: Consider separate agents for production vs development environments

## Limits

The following soft warnings apply to Subagent configurations (no hard limits are enforced):

- **Description Field**: A warning is shown for descriptions exceeding 1,000 characters
- **System Prompt**: A warning is shown for system prompts exceeding 10,000 characters
