# Local launch templates for `qwen serve` (v0.16-alpha)

Reference templates for running `qwen serve` as a long-lived background process on a developer workstation. Pairs with the [v0.16-alpha known limits](./qwen-serve.md#v016-alpha-known-limits) — local-only, single-user, BYO bearer token. Containerized / multi-host / TLS-fronted deployments defer to v0.16.x.

> **Audience**: dogfooding developers who want the daemon up across reboots, with logs going somewhere durable, and a clean `restart-on-failure` story. If you only need the daemon for the duration of a single shell session, plain `qwen serve` (foreground, Ctrl-C to stop) is fine.

## Generate a bearer token (once)

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32 > ~/.qwen-serve-token  # user-managed, NOT a built-in path
chmod 600 ~/.qwen-serve-token
export QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN="$(cat ~/.qwen-serve-token)"
```

The path / filename is yours to choose; v0.16-alpha does not auto-generate or auto-locate a token file (deferred to v0.16.x). See the [Authentication](./qwen-serve.md#authentication) section of the user guide for the canonical BYO setup.

> **Scope this `export` to the current shell session only.** Don't add it to `~/.bashrc` / `~/.zshrc` — a profile-level export exposes the bearer token to every process spawned from that shell (IDE subprocesses, browser debuggers, `npm` scripts from unrelated projects). For long-running setups, use the systemd `EnvironmentFile=` / launchd `EnvironmentVariables` mechanisms below — both scope the token to just the daemon process.

The daemon reads the bearer token from either `--token <value>` on the CLI or the `QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN` env var (whitespace stripped from both). The TypeScript SDK's `DaemonClient` constructor falls back to `QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN` when no `token` option is passed (PR 27 fallback — clients with the env var set never need to thread the value through their script).

One shell-level `export` covers both server boot and SDK client construction (just keep it scoped to the session, per the note above).

## Workspace lifecycle and process boundaries

One daemon can host several isolated workspace runtimes under the same listener.
Repeat `--workspace` with absolute directories to create explicit startup
runtimes; the first is primary. Primary and other explicit startup/static
runtimes cannot be removed without restarting the process.

Additional workspaces can also be registered while the daemon is running
through `POST /workspaces`. Pass `persist: true` to retain a dynamic secondary
in the user-level registration store so it is restored on the next start.
Untrusted registrations remain visible for diagnostics, bounded file reads,
and declared persisted reads but cannot start ACP. Dynamic and
persisted-restored secondaries are removable: a normal removal refuses while
the runtime is busy, while a forced removal requests termination of active
resources and commits logical removal before the same cwd can be re-added.
Cleanup is bounded and best-effort after the persistence commit point; failures
are logged rather than restoring the removed runtime.

Runtime isolation covers cwd, environment overlay, filesystem/trust boundary,
workspace services, bridge, Voice lease state, channel worker, and the ACP/MCP
resource boundary. Production attempts to preheat the primary ACP child and
retries on first use after failure; trusted secondaries start theirs on demand,
and untrusted secondaries do not start ACP.
Authentication, HTTP rate limits, listener and Voice admission caps,
total-session admission, metrics, shutdown, and the process fault radius remain
daemon-global. Run separate daemons when those process-level boundaries must be
independent.

## Linux: systemd user unit

> **Find your `qwen` binary first.** The unit file's `ExecStart=` must hold an **absolute path** — service managers don't read your shell's `PATH`. Run `which qwen` to discover it. Common locations: `/usr/local/bin/qwen` (Linuxbrew, manual installs), `~/.nvm/versions/node/vX.Y.Z/bin/qwen` (nvm), `~/.fnm/aliases/default/bin/qwen` (fnm), `~/.volta/bin/qwen` (Volta). Substitute the actual path everywhere the templates below show `/PATH/TO/qwen`.

`~/.config/systemd/user/qwen-serve.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Qwen Code daemon (loopback HTTP + SSE)
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
# Replace with your project; %h expands to $HOME under user units.
WorkingDirectory=%h/project-a
# Run `which qwen` to find the absolute path. systemd does NOT read $PATH.
ExecStart=/PATH/TO/qwen serve --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 4170 --workspace %h/project-a --workspace %h/project-b
# Read the bearer token from a chmod 600 file rather than inlining it
# in the unit. `Environment=` would expose the token in the unit file
# (typically 644 = world-readable). EnvironmentFile keeps the token in
# the user-owned secret file you already created with `chmod 600`.
EnvironmentFile=%h/.qwen-serve-token-env
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Build the env file once (the token file from the setup step holds the raw value; this wraps it in `KEY=value` form so systemd reads it as an env assignment):

```bash
echo "QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN=$(cat ~/.qwen-serve-token)" > ~/.qwen-serve-token-env
chmod 600 ~/.qwen-serve-token-env
```

Manage:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now qwen-serve.service
loginctl enable-linger "$(whoami)"               # keep the user manager running after logout / across reboot
journalctl --user -u qwen-serve -f               # tail logs
systemctl --user restart qwen-serve.service     # after token rotation
systemctl --user disable --now qwen-serve.service
```

Without `loginctl enable-linger`, the user-level systemd instance shuts down when the user logs out and only restarts on next login — on a headless dev box the daemon would not survive an SSH session ending. `enable-linger` is what makes "across reboots" actually work.

**System-wide alternative** (shared dev hosts, less common): drop the unit at `/etc/systemd/system/qwen-serve@.service` with `User=%i`, manage via `sudo systemctl enable --now qwen-serve@<username>.service`. Same `[Service]` body otherwise — but world-readable `Environment=` exposure is even more problematic at this level, so always use `EnvironmentFile=` pointing at the user's `chmod 600` file. Pick user-level + linger for single-user workstations.

## macOS: launchd user agent

> **Find your `qwen` binary first.** Same constraint as systemd — `ProgramArguments` must hold an **absolute path**. Run `which qwen` to discover it. Common locations on macOS: `/opt/homebrew/bin/qwen` (Homebrew on Apple Silicon), `/usr/local/bin/qwen` (Homebrew on Intel, manual installs), `~/.nvm/versions/node/vX.Y.Z/bin/qwen` (nvm), `~/.volta/bin/qwen` (Volta). Substitute below where the template shows `/PATH/TO/qwen`.

`~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.qwenlm.qwen-serve.plist`:

```

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Library/Logs/qwen-serve                                       # first time only
chmod 600 ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.qwenlm.qwen-serve.plist             # plist holds the inline token
launchctl load   ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.qwenlm.qwen-serve.plist
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.qwenlm.qwen-serve.plist      # to stop
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/qwen-serve/out.log ~/Library/Logs/qwen-serve/err.log
```

After editing the plist (e.g., rotating the token) you must `unload` then `load` again — `launchctl` does not auto-reload on plist changes the way `systemd daemon-reload` does. Note: each `load` truncates the log files, so save them off if you're investigating an incident before rotating.

## tmux session (interactive supervision)

Assumes `QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN` is already exported in your shell (see the setup section above):

```bash
tmux new -d -s qwen-serve "qwen serve --hostname 127.0.0.1 --workspace /absolute/path/project-a --workspace /absolute/path/project-b"
tmux attach -t qwen-serve   # see live logs; Ctrl-b d to detach
tmux kill-session -t qwen-serve
```

`tmux new -d` inherits the parent shell's environment, so `QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN` flows through automatically. Best when you want to occasionally watch the daemon's stdout (auth warnings, MCP discovery progress, slow-client warnings) without committing to a service unit. Survives terminal close but not host reboot.

## nohup one-liner (quick + dirty)

Assumes `QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN` is already exported in your shell:

```bash
nohup qwen serve --hostname 127.0.0.1 \
  --workspace /absolute/path/project-a \
  --workspace /absolute/path/project-b \
  > qwen-serve.log 2>&1 &
echo $!  # daemon PID; capture if you want to `kill` cleanly later
```

Explicit absolute `--workspace` values keep the daemon independent of the shell's current directory. A client should select one of the advertised `capabilities.workspaces[]` entries and pass its cwd when creating a session.

OK for one-off "let me run this in the background while I poke at the API" workflows. **Not recommended** for anything beyond a single session — no restart-on-crash, log file grows unbounded, no clean way to find the daemon if you forget the PID. Prefer tmux for interactive supervision or systemd / launchd for anything you want to outlast a reboot.

## Verifying the daemon is up

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:4170/health                                   # → {"status":"ok"}
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN" \
  http://127.0.0.1:4170/capabilities | jq .protocolVersions         # daemon's feature set
```

When auth is configured (i.e., the daemon was started with `--token` / `QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN` set, OR `--require-auth=true`), every route except `/health` on loopback binds requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. If you started the daemon without a token on the loopback default (the `qwen serve` zero-config path), neither call requires a header. The templates above all configure a token, so the `Authorization` header is needed in practice. If `/capabilities` returns `401`, the unit / plist token doesn't match the env-exported token your `curl` is using.

## Token rotation

1. Generate a new token + write the env file the unit references:
   ```bash
   openssl rand -hex 32 > ~/.qwen-serve-token
   chmod 600 ~/.qwen-serve-token
   echo "QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN=$(cat ~/.qwen-serve-token)" > ~/.qwen-serve-token-env
   chmod 600 ~/.qwen-serve-token-env
   ```
   (For the launchd / nohup / tmux templates: edit the plist's `<string>` value or re-`export QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN`. Don't forget `chmod 600` on the plist if you regenerate it.)
2. Restart the daemon:
   - **systemd**: `systemctl --user restart qwen-serve.service`
   - **launchd**: `launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.qwenlm.qwen-serve.plist && launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.qwenlm.qwen-serve.plist`
   - **tmux / nohup**: `kill <pid>` then re-run with the new token in env
3. Update any client SDKs / scripts. The TypeScript SDK's `DaemonClient` reads `QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN` automatically (PR 27 fallback) — re-`export` the new value in any client shell and reconstruct the client.

## Restart and crash behavior

Service-manager restart semantics differ across the templates:

- **systemd `Restart=on-failure`** — restart only on non-zero exit / signal. A clean SIGTERM (`systemctl stop`) does **not** trigger a restart loop.
- **launchd `KeepAlive` with `SuccessfulExit=false`** (the template above) — matches systemd behavior. A bare `<true/>` would have respawned even after a clean exit. `ThrottleInterval=10` rate-limits restart storms on persistent failures, mirroring systemd's `RestartSec=5`.
- **tmux / nohup** — no automatic restart. A daemon crash leaves you with a dead PID until you re-run.

Within a **single daemon process lifetime**, client disconnects recover via SSE `Last-Event-ID` resume per the [Durability model](./qwen-serve.md#durability-model) section of the user guide — the replay ring is in-memory.

A daemon **restart** drops all in-memory sessions; clients reconnect and start fresh. Cross-restart durability of session content (prompts, tool calls, conversation history) is **NOT** in v0.16-alpha.

## Out of scope (defers to v0.16.x or later)

- **Containerized deployment** — Dockerfile, docker-compose, Kubernetes manifests, nginx + TLS reverse proxy, multi-instance token isolation. Defers to v0.16.x once an enterprise pilot is committed; the doc would otherwise rot from no-one-validating.
- **Cross-host federation / multi-daemon coordination on one host** — one daemon can host multiple registered workspace runtimes, but daemons do not coordinate. Instance-path token keying + stale-token cleanup defer to v0.16.x.
- **General daemon token storage** — Local Control uses revocable daemon-owned pairing tokens, but long-lived runtime token storage remains BYO-token. Persistent token-store infrastructure defers to v0.16.x.
- **Windows native service** (`nssm`, Service Control Manager wrapper) — for now use [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) and follow the systemd section above.
