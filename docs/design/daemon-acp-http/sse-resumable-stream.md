## Problem

The `/acp` Streamable-HTTP session event stream (`GET /acp` with an
`Acp-Session-Id` header) is **live-only**: it neither emits an SSE `id:`
sequence nor honours a `Last-Event-ID` request header on reconnect.

When a control-plane proxy idle-closes the long-lived SSE connection
mid-turn (the daemon itself sends `retry: 3000`, and ingress proxies cut
long SSE frequently), the client reconnects and re-claims ownership, but
**every content frame the daemon produced during the gap is lost** —
`session/update` notifications carrying `agent_thought_chunk` /
`agent_message_chunk`. The turn still reaches a terminal state (a
`turn_complete` is produced / synthesised), so the UI shows "done" with an
empty or truncated body. Re-sending the same prompt works, which is the
tell: the loss is in the transport gap, not the model.

Symptom and field evidence are catalogued in the integration notes as
**§1.8** (`sdk-known-issues.md`).

## What already exists (and why this is small)

The replay engine is **already built and battle-tested** — the gap is only
that the `/acp` transport is not wired to it.

`packages/acp-bridge/src/eventBus.ts`:

- Monotonic per-session `id`, starting at 1 (`nextId`, assigned in
  `publish()`).
- Bounded ring buffer per session (`DEFAULT_RING_SIZE = 8000`, operator
  override `qwen serve --event-ring-size`).
- `subscribeEvents(sessionId, { lastEventId, signal })` replays ring frames
  with `id > lastEventId` before live events flow, and emits the synthetic
  control frames `replay_complete`, `state_resync_required` (ring-evicted /
  epoch reset on daemon restart), `client_evicted`, `slow_client_warning`.

The **REST** surface `GET /session/:id/events` already consumes all of
this: it reads `last-event-id` (`server.ts` → `parseLastEventId`), passes
it to `subscribeEvents`, and serialises each frame with an SSE `id:` line
(`formatSseFrame`). The bug is that the **`/acp` transport** does none of
this:

| Layer                                     | REST `/session/:id/events` | `/acp` GET (today)                            |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| reads `Last-Event-ID` header              | yes                        | **no**                                        |
| passes `lastEventId` to `subscribeEvents` | yes                        | **no** (`dispatch.ts pumpSessionEvents`)      |
| emits SSE `id:` line                      | yes (`formatSseFrame`)     | **no** (`SseStream.send` writes `data:` only) |

`acp-http/sse-stream.ts` even says so in a comment: _"no ring-buffer `id:`
sequencing — resumability is RFD Phase 4, deferred."_ This PR removes that
deferral.

## Wire decision — SSE `id:` line (not in-payload `_meta`)

The two SSE surfaces carry **different payloads**:

- REST streams **`BridgeEvent` envelopes** (`{ id, v, type, data, _meta }`).
  The SDK parser (`sdk-typescript/src/daemon/sse.ts`) extracts the cursor
  from the **JSON envelope's `id` field** (it only reads `data:` lines).
- `/acp` streams **raw JSON-RPC 2.0 objects** (`session/update`
  notifications, `session/request_permission` requests, responses). These
  have no envelope `id` to carry a bus cursor, and a JSON-RPC `id` means
  something else (request id).

So for `/acp` the resume cursor is the **standard SSE `id:` line**:

- It is EventSource-native — a spec-compliant SSE client (incl. the
  vendored `AcpHttpTransport`) auto-tracks the last `id:` and auto-sends it
  back as the `Last-Event-ID` header on reconnect.
- It keeps the JSON-RPC payload clean (no non-standard `_meta.qwen.eventId`
  injection into protocol frames).
- It mirrors what `formatSseFrame` already emits on REST, so both surfaces
  share the **same** `eventBus` ids and the same `Last-Event-ID` semantics.

Only **bus-originated** frames carry an `id:` (`session/update`,
`session/request_permission`, daemon-pushed notifies). JSON-RPC
**responses/replies** that ride the session stream are _not_ bus events and
carry **no** `id:` — they are not in the ring and are intentionally not
replay-tracked (a lost in-flight prompt _response_ is the separately-tracked
§1.7 concern, out of scope here; §1.8 is about lost _content_ frames, which
are all bus `session/update` events).

Synthetic terminal frames (`client_evicted`, `stream_error`, …) have no bus
`id` and so emit no `id:` line — matching REST, so they don't burn a slot in
the monotonic sequence the client resumes from.

## Changes

1. **`transport-stream.ts`** — `send(message, id?: number)`. The optional
   `id` is the bus event id for SSE cursor tracking.
2. **`sse-stream.ts`** — `send(message, id?)` prepends `id: ${id}\n` before
   the `data:` line when `id !== undefined` (mirrors `formatSseFrame`).
3. **`ws-stream.ts`** — `send(message, id?)` accepts and **ignores** `id`:
   WebSocket is a stateful connection, no SSE replay (consistent with
   `AcpWsTransport.supportsReplay = false`).
4. **`connection-registry.ts`** — `sendSession(sessionId, frame, id?)`
   threads `id` to the transport. The per-session pre-attach **buffer**
   stores one serialized UTF-8 payload with its optional cursor and budget
   lease, so a buffered frame keeps its cursor without retaining the source
   object or serializing it again on attach. Connection-scoped replies use the
   same representation.
5. **`dispatch.ts`**
   - `translateEvent` passes `event.id` through every `sendSession` /
     `binding.stream.send` call for bus events.
   - `pumpSessionEvents(conn, sessionId, signal, lastEventId?)` forwards
     `lastEventId` to `subscribeEvents` — directly reusing the existing
     ring replay.
6. **`index.ts`** — the `GET /acp` session-stream branch reads the
   `Last-Event-ID` header (via a strict `parseLastEventId`, same accept-only-
   decimal-digits rule as REST) and passes it to `pumpSessionEvents`.

No `eventBus`/bridge changes — the engine is reused verbatim.

## Making resume actually engage (session-stream grace/reclaim)

The `id:`/`Last-Event-ID` plumbing above is necessary but **not sufficient** —
on its own it never fires in the real flow. Previously, when a session SSE
stream closed at the transport level, the GET handler ran the **full**
`closeSessionStream` teardown: it removed the session from `ownedSessions`,
aborted the in-flight prompt, and detached the bridge client. In the real
EventSource/proxy order (old socket closes _first_, then the client
reconnects), that means a reconnect carrying `Last-Event-ID` is rejected
**403** by the ownership check before the cursor is ever read — and the prompt
producing the content was already aborted. The replay engine would have
nothing to reconnect to.

So a transport-level session-stream close now **detaches** instead of tears
down (`AcpConnection.detachSessionStream`): it stops only the stream + its
event subscription and **keeps the binding, ownership, the in-flight prompt,
and the bridge-client registration** alive for a grace window
(`SESSION_GRACE_MS`, mirroring `CONN_GRACE_MS`). A reconnect within the window
re-attaches (`attachSessionStream` clears the grace timer — reclaim) and the
ring replay backfills the gap. If no reconnect arrives, the grace timer runs
the full teardown — bounding the runaway-prompt cost. Full teardown remains
immediate for an explicit `session/close` and for connection teardown
(`destroy`). The GET handler branches on `stream.isClosed`: a transport close
→ detach-with-grace; a pump that ends while the stream is still open
(subprocess done / iterator error) → full close (zombie stream).

### Two replay-correctness guards this unlocks

Both are latent until resume actually runs; the grace/reclaim above makes them
reachable, so they ship together:

- **No double-delivery AND no silent loss (buffer ↔ ring).** A buffered bus
  event is _also_ in the EventBus ring (it was published there to get its id).
  So on a resume (`Last-Event-ID` present), `attachSessionStream` is given the
  cursor and **does not flush id-bearing buffered frames at all** — the ring
  replay (started at the client's cursor) is the single delivery path for every
  bus event after the cursor. This is deliberately _not_ "flush the buffer, then
  advance the replay cursor past it": a frame sent to the now-dead socket but
  never received by the client has an id _below_ the buffer's ids yet _above_ the
  client's cursor, so advancing the cursor past the buffer would **silently drop
  it**. Letting the ring own all bus events delivers each exactly once with no
  gap. Id-_less_ frames (JSON-RPC replies routed via `replySession`) are not ring
  events, so the ring won't redeliver them — but they must not be flushed at
  attach either: a buffered `session/prompt` _result_ flushed before replay would
  arrive ahead of the content chunks that preceded it (client sees "done" before
  the body — the exact truncated-body failure §1.8 fixes). So on resume the
  id-less frames are **deferred**: left in the buffer, and the event pump releases
  them (`flushBufferedSessionFrames`) once replay drains — on `replay_complete`
  **only**, preserving original stream order. Crucially NOT on
  `state_resync_required`: the EventBus emits that frame _before_ the replay
  frames (then still emits `replay_complete` at the end), so flushing on it would
  put the reply ahead of the replayed content. The live-only case (no
  `Last-Event-ID` ⇒ no replay ⇒ no `replay_complete`) is covered by the pump's
  post-loop safety flush. (A fresh connect with no `Last-Event-ID` has no ring
  anchor, so it flushes the whole buffer immediately, in order, as before.)
- **Idempotent `permission_request` under replay.** A `permission_request` is
  an id-bearing ring event, so a reconnect whose cursor precedes a still-
  unanswered permission replays it. `translateEvent` now reuses the existing
  `conn.pending` entry for that `bridgeRequestId` (re-sending the same outbound
  JSON-RPC id for catch-up) instead of minting a second id + entry — no orphan
  pending, no double-prompt for a client that dedupes on `_meta.requestId`.

`parseLastEventId` is extracted to a shared `serve/sse-last-event-id.ts` used
by both the REST and `/acp` surfaces, so their strict accept/reject rules and
operator logging can't drift.

## Backward compatibility

Pre-attach queues are bounded by both count and serialized payload bytes. One
stream owns at most 256 frames, one logical connection at most 1,024 frames and
64 MiB, and all ACP HTTP mounts share a process-global 4,096-frame/256-MiB
budget. A fresh attach transfers the lease to the transport writer and releases
it only after local delivery or definitive failure. If SSE accepts a complete
frame but closes before its final write callback, delivery is outcome-unknown;
an ownership-granting response preserves the session rather than deleting it.
If the logical connection is still live, ownership is conservatively
committed; during connection teardown, the client is detached while persisted
session data remains available for resume. Resume still discards
id-bearing buffered events in favor of authoritative ring replay and preserves
id-less reply ordering, but that discard now releases the retained byte lease.
Overflow closes the exact session; connection-scoped or shared-WebSocket
overflow closes the logical connection instead of evicting an older frame.

- **Old clients that don't send `Last-Event-ID`** → `lastEventId` is
  `undefined` → `subscribeEvents` starts live, exactly as today.
- **Adding `id:` lines is backward-compatible SSE** — a client that ignores
  the field is unaffected; an EventSource-based one starts tracking it for
  free.
- **The vendored SDK `AcpHttpTransport` opts in to replay in this PR** —
  it sets `supportsReplay = true` and resends `Last-Event-ID` on reconnect,
  so gap frames are replayed from the ring and the §1.8 content loss is
  closed with **no further daemon change needed**. (The separate external
  `agent-web` transport flip stays deferred — see Out of scope.) The daemon
  change remains inert for any consumer that still reports
  `supportsReplay = false` and omits the header.
- The REST surface is untouched.

## Test plan

- `sse-stream.test.ts` — `send(msg, 7)` emits `id: 7\n` before `data:`;
  `send(msg)` (no id) omits the `id:` line; ordering `id:` → `data:` →
  blank line.
- `transport.test.ts` (end-to-end over the `/acp` transport):
  - live `session/update` frames now arrive with an `id:` line;
  - a `GET /acp` carrying `Last-Event-ID: N` flows the cursor to
    `subscribeEvents`; a fresh stream with no header behaves as today;
  - an overflow `Last-Event-ID` (> `MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`) → live-only;
  - **real close-then-reconnect order**: close the old SSE _first_, then
    reconnect with `Last-Event-ID` — assert **200 not 403** (ownership kept)
    and the prompt is **not** aborted (grace/reclaim);
  - a replayed `permission_request` reuses the pending entry (same outbound id).
- `connection-registry.test.ts` — a non-resume attach flushes the whole buffer
  threading each frame's `id`; a **resume** attach (cursor present) skips the
  id-bearing frames (ring replay owns them) but still flushes id-less JSON-RPC
  replies; `detachSessionStream` keeps ownership/prompt across the grace window
  then tears down on expiry; a reconnect within the window reclaims (cancels the
  pending teardown).
- `ws-stream.test.ts` — `send(msg, id)` ignores the id: the WS wire frame is the
  bare JSON, no SSE `id:` framing leaks in.

## Out of scope (still deferred)

- WebSocket / HTTP/2 transports.
- §1.7 cross-connection permission resolve (a vote POSTed on a different
  `Acp-Connection-Id` than the one that streamed the prompt) — a separate,
  security-sensitive concern tracked as its own follow-up. This PR does make
  `permission_request` translation idempotent under replay (above), but does
  not add the session-global requestId resolve. It also does not add
  **response-replay idempotency for an ALREADY-RESOLVED permission**: once the
  client has voted, the pending entry is consumed, so a later reconnect that
  replays the (still-ringed) `permission_request` re-sends the prompt with the
  same `_meta.requestId`. A conformant client dedupes on that id (the contract
  the replay path already relies on) and the residual orphan pending entry is
  reaped at teardown — the agent never stalls — but recording resolved outcomes
  in a bounded per-session LRU to re-send the recorded vote (full idempotency
  for non-deduping clients) belongs with this same permission-coordination
  follow-up, since it adds resolved-permission state to the vote path.
- The lost in-flight _prompt response_ on the session stream — recovered
  content frames all flow through the `eventBus` ring; a JSON-RPC response is
  not a ring event.
- Consumer-side `supportsReplay` flip in the external `agent-web`
  `AcpHttpTransport` (lives in a different repo; unblocked by this PR).
- **Permission voting through the exported SDK transports.** The exported
  `AcpHttpTransport`/`AcpWsTransport` surface `session/request_permission` as a
  `permission_request` event, but the SDK's vote APIs
  (`respondToPermission` / `respondToSessionPermission`) map to a
  `session/permission` request the ACP daemon has no handler for — it only
  accepts a permission vote as the JSON-RPC _response_ echoing the outbound
  `_qwen_perm_N` id. Wiring the vote round-trip is part of the §1.7
  permission-coordination follow-up. A related facet: the no-subscriber session
  **reply pump** (`ensureSessionReplyPump`) opens a real `GET /acp` session
  stream, which the daemon treats as a live stream — so an agent
  `permission_request` raised while only the reply pump is attached is ROUTED to
  that stream and dropped by the pump (it forwards only JSON-RPC responses),
  hanging the mediator, whereas with no stream at all the daemon cancel-denies
  and the agent proceeds. Both the daemon-side "is this a real consumer or just
  a reply pump?" distinction and the SDK-side handling (deny locally / surface
  to a permission callback) belong with the same permission-coordination
  follow-up, since the pump cannot itself cast a vote. Consumers that need
  permission handling should open `subscribeEvents` before issuing session RPCs
  (the documented contract), which gives the daemon a real consumer stream.
- **Session RPCs issued from inside the `subscribeEvents` loop on the exported
  `AcpHttpTransport`.** The session `/acp` stream is single-reader: while a
  consumer's async generator is parked between `yield`s, the reader is not
  draining. If the consumer `await`s a session-routed RPC (`session/set_model`,
  `session/prompt`, …) from within its own event-handling loop, `sendRequest`
  suppresses the background reply pump (a subscription is "active") yet the
  parked generator never reads the reply — the call hangs until the consumer
  pulls the next event. The robust fix is to make the session reader a
  background pump that always drains JSON-RPC replies and queues only
  `DaemonEvent`s for the iterator; deferred as a focused follow-up since it is a
  structural change to an opt-in, newly-exported transport and does not affect
  the default REST transport.
- **Automated guard for the `SESSION_STREAM_REPLY_METHODS` ⇄ `replySession`
  drift.** The SDK's `SESSION_STREAM_REPLY_METHODS` set must mirror the daemon's
  `replySession(...)` call sites in `dispatch.ts` (a different package); a method
  added there without adding it here opens no reply pump and a no-subscriber
  `sendRequest` for it hangs until abort. Neither package's type system enforces
  this. A CI guard (a lightweight script or vitest that extracts the daemon's
  session-reply method names and diffs them against the SDK set) is the right
  fix, but cross-package static-analysis tooling is its own focused task — and
  not a trivial grep: a correct extractor needs light dataflow analysis, because
  `session/prompt`'s reply is NOT emitted inside its `case 'session/prompt'`
  block. The prompt kicks off asynchronously and its `replySession(...)` fires
  later from the prompt-completion handler (a different call site), so a naive
  "which `case` blocks contain `replySession`" scan would wrongly EXCLUDE
  `session/prompt` and fail the build against a correct set. The set is small and
  stable in the meantime, and the JSDoc on the constant documents the invariant;
  the robust long-term fix is to have the daemon advertise its session-routed
  method names (a shared source of truth) rather than scrape `dispatch.ts`.
