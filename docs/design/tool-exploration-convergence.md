# Read-only exploration convergence reminder

[English](tool-exploration-convergence.md) | [简体中文](tool-exploration-convergence.zh-CN.md)

## Problem and scope

Issue #13321 requests an actionable convergence point when diverse discovery calls succeed without advancing a deliverable. The adaptive default tool-call cap permits useful diverse calls past its soft threshold. This proposal adds a reminder at that threshold; it does not add a new halt, infer task intent, force writes, or change permissions. Repeated execution failures and their operator rollout policy in #10887 remain separate.

The threshold equals `model.maxToolCallsPerTurn` (default 100) and counts one continuous read-only phase within a logical turn, so the motivating incident's observed call count (about 92 mixed calls, whose read phases were repeatedly reset by interleaved non-read calls) does not by itself guarantee a reminder.

## Behavior

Track a continuous phase of calls whose registered kind is `Read`, `Search`, or `Fetch`; `lsp` and `tool_search` are counted as exploration reads despite registering `Kind.Other` (retyping them would change scheduler concurrency semantics). Resolve bridged `tool_call` targets through the registry, so declared read-only MCP tools do not depend on their names. Planning, implementation, delegation and unknown kinds end the phase. At `model.maxToolCallsPerTurn` calls, insert one reminder after the tool results asking the model to use gathered information, proceed toward the requested deliverable or explain a blocker. For read-only requests, ask for findings and remaining questions. The reminder grants no new tool permission or plan approval.

Keep the existing adaptive and explicit hard-cap semantics. A disabled/infinite allowance produces no reminder. Continued legitimate investigation remains allowed; the reminder does not assert that every read is stagnation. Another reminder is possible only after a non-read phase or a new logical turn. The interactive loop-detector disable also suppresses the core reminder.

## Ownership and compatibility

Core owns one budget alongside its existing logical-turn loop detector. Retry and model fallback roll back uncommitted call observations, provider duplicate call IDs are counted once, and existing user/Goal/Stop turn resets clear the budget. A concurrent side query (`/btw`) does not reset the running turn's phase. ACP owns a budget in each daemon tool-loop state, shared by that loop's tool-result continuations. Foreground, channel, Stop/todo, cron and notification loops instantiate that state. The subagent reasoning loop is excluded: it drives `LlmChat` directly and never enters the client or daemon tool loops that record and inject, so a runaway subagent remains bounded by its existing per-turn cap only. Older callers constructing the exported state shape without the optional budget keep their previous behavior. No state is shared between sessions and no arguments, result contents or identifiers are retained in the budget.

The rollback extension is budget-local. The loop detector's own per-turn cap rollback stays Retry-only: a production model fallback can only precede its own attempt's calls (the chain runs only when the failed attempt yielded no candidate output), so there is nothing to roll back, and clearing the detector's accumulated streak evidence per round-trip would silently disable the consecutive-identical and stagnation guards for turns served through repeated fallbacks.

The counter observes emitted/accepted call kinds rather than semantically proving successful progress. A non-read request resets the phase even if its execution later fails; the existing failure protections retain responsibility for that case. Two consequences are accepted: bookkeeping tools (`todo_write`, memory) reset the phase, and the runtime's own active-todo nudge re-injects every 3 tool turns, so a todo-maintaining session effectively never accumulates 100 consecutive read-kind calls — that variant of #13321 is out of this feature's coverage. A model may ignore the reminder, so a controlled provider can verify insertion and runtime behavior but cannot establish production-model convergence or token savings.

## Validation and acceptance

Verify threshold, one-shot behavior, implementation/planning resets, disabled allowance and retry rollback with focused tests. Verify arbitrary and bridged registered MCP kinds. Use actual CLI/tmux with distinct real file reads and capture the outgoing reminder, continued read-only tool availability, natural completion and any auxiliary model requests separately. Native evidence must be pinned to executed source/build identities. Existing cap and permission checks remain authoritative. Keep a productive phase and a legitimate broad read-only investigation valid without forced writes.

## Open boundary

The reminder is a deterministic insertion with nondeterministic model response. A stronger semantic completion gate would require a separate declared task/progress contract; this proposal does not invent one.
