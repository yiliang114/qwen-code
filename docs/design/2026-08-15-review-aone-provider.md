# Phase 2: Aone Code read path for /review

> Status: draft. Parent: `docs/design/2026-08-13-review-platform-provider-abstraction.md`.
> Phase 0+1 (GitHub provider) merged as #9096 (`dc7e234876`).

## Problem

Phase 0+1 added the `ReviewPlatformReader` seam with one provider (GitHub).
`/review` still cannot review a MaxCompute CR on Aone Code (`odps_src`), which
is the motivating target. This phase adds the Aone read path so a local review
of an Aone CR works end to end (diff + worktree + issue evidence + agent
findings), and `--comment` on an Aone target refuses cleanly.

## Verified platform facts (re-confirmed 2026-08-15 against `maxcompute/odps_src`)

## Proposed scope (vertical slice — confirm before implementing)

**In scope (makes local Aone review work):**

1. `lib/platform/aone-client.ts` — a1 transport sibling to `lib/gh.ts`,
   replicating its contract: `execFileSync` without shell, transient retry only
   on idempotent reads, byte mode for diffs, actionable auth check
   (`a1 auth whoami`), and `--repo` threading (Aone has no `GH_HOST` analogue;
   the repo coordinate is passed per call).
2. `lib/platform/aone.ts` — implements `ReviewPlatformReader`:
   `resolveRepo` (parse the clone's origin URL → `gitlab.alibaba-inc.com/<g>/<p>`),
   `getPrMeta` (mr view → sourceBranch/detailUrl), `getClosingIssues` (workitem
   list), `getIssue` (workitem get), `fetchDiff` (git-based after fetching the
   ref; a1 per-file diff only for lightweight mode), `getCommentBody` (read
   `note` from comment list).
3. **Detection** in `registry.ts`: select the platform from (a) an explicit
   `--host` whose host is an Aone host, (b) an explicit `--remote` URL on an
   Aone host, else (c) the cwd clone's origin. An explicit NON-Aone
   host/remote beats the cwd probe (so an explicitly-GitHub subcommand run
   from an Aone clone is not hijacked). The four reader-backed subcommands
   (meta/issue-context/fetch-diff/comment-body) thread `--host` into
   detection; fetch-pr threads the remote URL. (An explicit `--platform`
   override is deferred — an explicit `--host` already serves as the
   practical override.)
4. `fetch-pr.ts` — provider-aware refspec + metadata: Aone uses
   `refs/merge-requests/<global-id>/head` and mr-view metadata (no
   additions/deletions — compute from the fetched diff). This is the enabler
   for worktree mode, build/test, and the full agent review.

**Deferred to a follow-up (degrade gracefully in this phase):**

- `pr-context.ts` discussion rendering (inline threads, review summaries,
  ledger): Aone has comments but no GitHub review-summary model. For v1, Aone
  runs enter the existing **context-unavailable** mode (verdict caps at
  COMMENT; findings still generated). Note Agent 0 (issue fidelity) is gated
  on `pr-context` success, so it is SKIPPED on Aone too — `issue-context`
  works standalone for the workitem evidence but is not wired to Agent 0.
- `comment-status.ts` anchor-status and `presubmit.ts` CI checks: skip for
  Aone v1 (the skill already handles their absence).

`--comment` on an Aone target refuses with a clear message (posting is Phase 3).

## Key design decisions

- **Transport is a sibling, not a refactor of gh.ts.** `isOwnerRepo`,
  `HOSTNAME_RE`, and the host-routing state (`setGhHost`/`resolveGhHost`/
  `getGhHost`) are currently gh.ts-owned. Aone has no global host routing
  (repo coordinate per call), so the shared surface is the _validators_
  (move `isOwnerRepo`/`HOSTNAME_RE` into `lib/platform/` or a shared
  `lib/validate.ts`) — not the gh host state.
- **Detection is cheap and explicit.** Remote-URL host is already parsed by
  `match-remote`'s matcher; the reader threads `--host`/the remote URL into
  detection. An explicit non-Aone signal beats the cwd probe.
- **Diff is git-based.** Fetching the MR ref makes Aone diffs identical to
  GitHub's (merge-base + unified diff), so `plan-diff`/chunking need no
  Aone branch. `a1 mr diff` is only the lightweight fallback.
- **Global id is the review number.** Aone CR URLs carry the global id; the
  reader uses it for refs/`mr view`/comments/workitems.

## Files affected

- New: `lib/platform/aone-client.ts`, `lib/platform/aone.ts` (+ tests).
- Modified: `lib/platform/types.ts` (add `'aone'` to `PlatformKind`),
  `lib/platform/registry.ts` (detection), `fetch-pr.ts` (provider routing),
  possibly a shared validators module, `parse-args.ts` (Aone CR URL grammar
  `/codereview/<id>`), `meta.ts`/`issue-context.ts`/`fetch-diff.ts`/
  `comment-body.ts` (platform selection + non-GitHub `--host` semantics),
  `SKILL.md` (Aone target handling + lightweight/detect guidance),
  `docs/users/features/code-review.md`.

## Open questions

1. **Scope**: ship the minimal slice (reader + detection + fetch-pr;
   pr-context/comment-status/presubmit degrade), or also make `pr-context`
   render Aone comments (bigger lift)? Recommendation: minimal slice.
2. Aone comment threading (`closed`, `outdated`) vs GitHub's
   `in_reply_to_id`/`line` model — only matters if `comment-status` joins.
3. build/test (Agent 7) on a Bazel monorepo needs a repo-config escape hatch
   (already flagged out of scope in the parent doc); confirm it degrades
   cleanly rather than attempting a full `bazel build`.
